these are the following deals I have amended the time zones to PPT instead of 
PST and amended the strips to reflect the change:
534066

Also, these are only the brokered deals between Tom and Mark.  There may be 
some non-brokered deals in enpower with a flow of April and the time zone 
needs to be changed to PPT and the strips amended as well.  Can you please 
run a query and check the other deals to make sure the time zone is correct 
because if not they will not be scheduled correctly for April. 

If you have any question please call me.

$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from..

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Nevada governor Kenny Guinn will decide by early 
next week on whether to implement electricity deregulation by November, as 
recommended by the state's Public Utilities Commission, a spokesman for the 
governor said Monday.   

Deregulation was set to become law March 1, 2000, but was stalled due to a 
lawsuit brought by Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) Co. unit Nevada power that 
challenged deregulation as unconstitutional. Nevada Power withdrew the 
lawsuit after the state approved a $110 million rate increase for the 
utility's customers. 

Guinn's spokesman would not say why the governor was considering a delay in 
deregulation.   

""All those details will be discussed when the decision is announced,"" said 
spokesman Jack Finn.   

The PUC's proposed deregulation schedule calls for competition to begin with 
large commercial customers on Nov. 1, 2000, followed by medium commercial 
customers April 1, 2001, and residential customers Sept. 1, 2001.

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  

   

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)-  Electricity customers in several Western states 
are getting cold feet about their upcoming deregulation deadlines after 
watching San Diegans' bills more than double under deregulation this summer. 

The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission held a public meeting Tuesday to 
discuss consumers' requests for a delay in that state's scheduled Jan. 1, 
2002, deregulation start date.   

""Everyone is worried about the fly-up in wholesale and retail prices in San 
Diego as the result of a tight market, so they're asking for a delay until 
more supply can be secured,"" said John Curl, director of the PRC's utility 
division.   

In Nevada, Governor Kenny Guinn has postponed signing that state's 
deregulation schedule several times amid pressure from legislators concerned 
about higher rates for constitutents. Guinn is expected to make a decision by 
early next week, which means deregulation could get underway as soon as Nov. 
1, 2000.   

Oregon has also taken California's troubles seriously. Under electricity 
restructuring rules adopted late last month, large industrial and 
nonresidential customers will deregulate starting Oct. 1, 2001, but 
residential and small commercial customers will still get a regulated rate.   

""This is the first big step in implementing electric restructuring in Oregon 
in a unique way that is very different from what California and other states 
have done,"" said Oregon Public Utilities Commission chairman Ron Eachus.

Calif Regulators Ask Utils For Extensive Financial Info
By Mark Golden
? 
10/12/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The California Public Utilities Commission has 
requested extensive financial information from the state's three 
investor-owned utilities and their parent companies. 
Administrative law judge Angela Minkin ruled the information should be given 
in response to a pleading by PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX), 
which want the PUC to change deregulation rules to allow them to recover the 
enormous losses they are now incurring in wholesale electricity markets. 
""Minkin has directed the utilities by Oct. 17 to go open-kimono with all of 
their financial data since 1998 and, in some cases, since 1997,"" said Daniel 
Douglass, a partner in the law firm Arter & Hadden LLP, which is representing 
most of the state's independent power producers, the California Power 
Exchange and some of nonutility retail electricity providers in the 
proceedings. 
The judge's request covers numerous revenue accounts, asset values of power 
plants still owned by the utilities, documents on assets transferred and 
significant payments made from the regulated utilities to unregulated 
subsidiaries, bond information, and net earnings for the parent companies and 
all subsidiaries for each quarter between 1997 and 2000. 
Minkin also requested an itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by 
any entity other than the California ISO, the state's grid operator, and the 
California PX, the state's power exchange, for power purchased in California 
by the utilities and their affiliates. 
In addition, the judge wants a description of all utility affiliates' 
activities in California electric markets and signed affidavits by the 
utilities' officers attesting to the veracity of the information. 
""The information will also permit the Commission to evaluate recent claims to 
investors and the media by PG&E and Edison that their power purchase 
liabilities have undermined their financial integrity,"" Minkin wrote in the 
ruling. ""The seriousness of these claims imposes a responsibility on 
regulators to fully evaluate the utilities' financial circumstances on behalf 
of utility customers and the state."" 
A combination of surging wholesale power prices and caps on retail rates has 
produced billions of dollars losses at Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern 
California Edison, the regulated units of PG&E and Edison International. 
The utilities want the ability to recover those losses after the transition 
to deregulation and its fixed-rate regime end in 2002. 
Failure to supply the information could result in fines, Minkin wrote. 
It would also likely jeopardize the utilties' chance of succeeding in getting 
the rules changed, Western Power Trading Forum's Douglass said. 
""If the utilities want to have these decisions modified, they need to 
document the financial straits they're in,"" Douglass said. ""If they don't 
provide, they open up themselves up to losing their request."" 
The extensiveness of the disclosures is similar to that in the subpoenas 
issued to many Western Power Trading Forum member companies in other 
investigations of California's wholesale power market. Douglass said the 
information would be available to all parties to the proceedings. 
Douglass said the utilities haven't yet objected to the ruling, which was 
issued late Friday. 
Southern California Edison declined to comment Thursday.

You pinch pennies, wait for sales, and compare prices. But have you  ever 
gone shopping to lower your utility bills? A handful of Internet  companies 
are hoping you will in the next few years.  

The fledgling companies already are saving money for consumers in the  
handful of states that have deregulated electric power and natural gas.  They 
expect a flood of interest as more states deregulate. In the  meantime, 
they're luring new customers with cut- rate deals on other  services from 
long-distance telephone service to satellite television  and even gasoline. 

Their formula: Lure hundreds of thousands of bill-payers to a single  Web 
site where they can find great deals.  

""It is the Web that has made it possible for consumers to come together  
nationwide,"" says Sanjay Chopra, chairman and chief executive of  
OnlineChoice.com, a Pittsburgh-based Internet service. ""The power has  
shifted - and we're enabling that process - from the producers to  
consumers.""  

""Every month you have these bills. They're unavoidable,"" adds Matt Coffin, 
chief executive and founder of LowerMyBills.com, based in Los Angeles. ""Who 
wants to pay more than they need to for monthly bills?""

The message is catching on. In a year, LowerMyBills has grown from nothing to 
a marketplace of more than 250,000 people who are looking to  cut costs. The 
site bills itself as a marketplace for utility- type  services. Online users 
can select among three long-distance services  that charge anywhere from 4.9 
cents to 6.9 cents a minute. If they sign  up, LowerMyBills gets a 
commission.  

The company also offers Internet access and low-interest credit cards,  as 
well as electric power and natural gas in some deregulated states.  If 
homeowners signed up for all of the services the company offered,  they would 
save an average $3,000 a year apiece, Mr. Coffin claims.  

""It's not just cost or price that attracts customers to our  marketplace,"" 
says Paul Lewis, president of Essential.com, an online  energy and 
communications marketplace. ""They're also looking for  convenience."" The 
Burlington, Mass. company sends customers their bills  online and charges 
their credit-card accounts, saving them time but  also reducing the company's 
costs.  

Sometimes the companies are independent, such as OnlineChoice,  LowerMyBills, 
and Essential.com, as well as Utility.com, based in  Emeryville, Calif.; and 
GreenMountain.com, a South Burlington, Vt.  provider of environmentally 
cleaner energy. Sometimes, they're tied to  big energy companies. In May, for 
example, Enron Corporation joined  forces with America Online and IBM Corp. 
to begin selling electricity  and natural gas. The company, dubbed the New 
Power Company, is  marketing its services via the Internet to customers in 
Pennsylvania  and New Jersey.   

OnlineChoice.com uses a slightly different strategy. It pools together  
potential customers and then goes out and negotiates the best possible  deal 
for them. For example, 70,000 consumers agreed to register (with  no 
obligation) for long-distance telephone service. That customer base  was 
enough to convince GTC Telecom to offer members a price break: 4.7  cents a 
minute with no monthly fees or minimums.  

The company has also attracted a buying pool of 65,000 consumers for  cheaper 
electricity. Currently, the company offers such deals in some  seven states. 
But the pace of reform remains slow.  

Even in some of the states that have deregulated, competition hasn't  
flourished. Pennsylvania set prices for traditional utilities so low  that 
new companies found it difficult to compete. In Massachusetts,  pricing 
problems also caused only a small fraction of customers - 0.4  percent last 
year - to switch. And most of them were large businesses.  

Analysts expect more states to deregulate soon, which should open up  still 
more business for the online discounters.   

By 2005, more than a quarter of online households will use the Internet  to 
trim their energy bills, according to the Yankee Group. 

""There are a number of very appealing markets that are opening up to  
competition,"" says Bob Potter, vice president of business development  for 
energy for Essential.com. ""The regulations that they're putting in  place are 
better."" (c) Copyright 2000. The Christian Science Publishing Society Folder

As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

Foster said SoCal Edison is being forced to borrow millions of dollars to 
cover the difference between what it pays for wholesale power and what it 
charges its customers during the rate freeze. 
The company's stock has been taking a beating in recent weeks as Wall Street 
learned about the utility's $2 billion debt. 
Current wholesale power prices are about 20 cents/KWh, but the utility 
charges its customers about 3 to 4 cents/KWh. 
That could end if SoCal Edison convinces state regulators that it recovered 
its stranded costs related to the sale of its power plants. 
The utility's recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
suggests that the pending sale of its hydro generating assets will allow it 
to end the rate freeze and start charging its customers market-based rates. 
But Foster said the company wants to protect its customers. 
""We believe the rate freeze is going to end sooner or later and consumers 
cannot be exposed to a volatile market,"" Foster said. ""Our primary goal is to 
protect consumers and provide them with affordable, reliable and predictable 
rates."" 
Still, the utility is going to have to convince state regulators of its 
intentions. Foster said the company will file with the Public Utilities 
Commission soon, possibly to lift the rate freeze, based on the pending sale 
of its hydro assets, and to raise its rates. 
""We don't want to have California in a state of chaos,"" Foster said. ""We hope 
to have a cooperative agreement with state regulators when the time comes.""

The Homestretch
Trying to hit the oil button while it is hot, Texas Gov. George W. Bush plans 
to unveil an energy plan Friday.  Larry Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economics 
adviser, says it would focus on increasing domestic energy production, 
promoting conservation and coaxing more production out of oil-exporting 
nations.  A particular focus will be on streamlining the granting of  permits 
for construction of refineries, pipelines and power plants.  Mr. Bush says 
the Clinton-Gore administration has clogged the permitting process, helping 
produce shortfalls in supply of home-heating oil and electricity production."

There is a new binder for EPE hourly deals for 2002. The deal sheets MUST be kept in this binder. We are currently missing the deal sheet for 12/30/01 to 01/01/02. Please be on the lookout for this sheet or sheets. Those who were on shift for that period will need to coordinate what deals were done and will need to reconstruct a sheet. 

These sheets are currently a main source of information on EPE for settlements. The deal sheets should be clear, concise, and should have information such as energy type, delivery point, who you spoke with and at what time.

I will be sending another email regarding EPE procedure and model updates for 2002.

We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.

Please use appropriate dollar and mw values. Below is JUST an example. When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.

	 
IMPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$49	$49	$74	99	149	174	199	249	249

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.

	1.	All deals will be done under ST-Whourly. If there is lending, parking or a cut that corresponds to another book, we will make that deal for the entire strip (for 	example, W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22all one deal). We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book (this interdesk deal 	will not be routed). We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include 	transmission charges when necessary. In Enpower, use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling.

	2. 	All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk (for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS).
	This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk. Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for 	wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks. When filling a Service customer (such as Wheelabrator or EES) we should pay for the import and export 	fees.

	3.	A ""skeleton"" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day.  Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and 	immediately input into the service sheet. Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible.

I would like to implement all of these practices immediately. Effective HE 1 08/29/01, THIS is our new business practice. Spread the word. I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process. We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement. This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th. Please plan to attend.

As we have more and more cuts, we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique. (YES!)

 1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as ""confirmed"" (this will allow us to sort for cut or ""confirmed"" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.

2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING. On imports to CALI, please zero out the purchase outside of CALI, zero out the EpmiCalPool, and then make a purchase under the book that had the import (likely EPMI Short Term Cali) from the California Imbalance (remember no price and 24 POS on the group).

IF you have any questions, please call me. We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts, particularly imports into California.

I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism.
1. Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials)
2. The CISO Table 1. lists an unintended consequence as "" Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver""
	Why is there no obligation to deliver?
3. Is there still a load deviation penalty? Or would that be considered seperately?

Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, Williams, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21. 

NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login. 

Following are a few pointers to help you get started. 

1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under ""Tools.""
2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose ""West"" and click ""Okay.""
3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.
4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule
5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the ""Control"" button and while selecting multiple rows.
6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.
7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called ""Cut Information"" will come up. Select the ""New Path Cut"" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.)
8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.

Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)"

Ryan sent this email out once already, here it is again.  The oasis site map is http://www.nwoasis.org/OASIS/NODE
The details of checking for ATC are as such Red=PAC(t), Blue=IPC(t)

Leg 1. PACW to ENPR
Leg 2. ENPR to BOBR
Leg 3. BOBR to PATHC
Leg 4. PATHC to PACE
Leg 5. PACE to FC3

We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well.
When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC (t) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately.  This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.  Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.  There will also be losses.  If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.  Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!  There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.  This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days.
Please see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Keoni,

Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.
 
I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.

I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.

I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.

I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.

I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.

I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.

I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.

I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.
Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.

At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.
I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.

While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.

I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. 


I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.

Thank you for your help.

We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE.  25 mws will be under ST-SW, 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM.

We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15.  25 mws will be under ST-WBOM, 40 mws will be under ST-CALI.

Both schedules are HE 7-22.  All deals should be under appropriate books.  Please take extra time with the EPE lending.  We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems.  Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate.

This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks.  I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it.  We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon.  I am working on adding you to the market status list, this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders.  Finally, I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks.  Boring, but important.

So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.

1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method)

2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.

3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.

4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be:
Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain Jack, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.

Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.

5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. 

	a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion managementthan an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four 	Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to 	Four Corners. 

	b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zonefor example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.

6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.

Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,

Bill"

Two totally different issues for you.

First:  When scheduling transmission on Portland General Electric from John Day to Malin we MUST use deal #146517, we MUST make the price zero.  We extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points.  We then make an annuity to ST-NW for losses.  Easy.

Second: For the third time in two weeks the behavior of the Real-Time Group after 6 PM has been brought up.  We will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week.  It is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times.  Enron has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment (language or behavior that offends or belittles others).

Thanks for your attention.

Recently there have been complaints regarding chew in the kitchen sink, chew scattered around the edge of garbage cans, and chew spit cups left on desks. Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products, we are the most visible. The relaxed atmosphere of our group is a priviledge and I expect each person in the group to be responsible for the appearence of our desk and the perception of our desk by others on our floor. Leaving chew spit cups on other desks or throwing chew in the sink is unacceptable. It is a simple thing.

1.) Notes as usual

2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY importantAll CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).

3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just ""bow out"" gracefully if you have no other options with the words ""L - D's.""

4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.

Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE. Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.

This will probably not be a fun weekend. 
I appreciate your help.

I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.  From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.  I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.  Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday.  I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.  Overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.  Feel free to see me with questions.

By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping 
and eHR Online.  Well it is almost upon us.  Some of the business units in 
GPG will implement self-service time entry but ET&S along with other business 
units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will 
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation, 
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new 
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper 
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period 
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new 
system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more time 
to complete payrolls.  If you have changes to your timesheet after you have 
submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary 
adjustments will be made the following pay period."

NOT YET EFFECTIVE    BUT FYI

 We have Master Agreements in place with each of these entities.   We have 
sent to ONEOK a Transfer and Termination Agreement under which  the following 
will occur once it becomes effective.

1. Oneok II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master 
Agreement to Oneok L.P.

2. The ONEOK LP Master Agreement will be terminated and all trades will be 
done under the ONEOK II Master Agreement.


In summary, once the Transfer and Termination Agreement becomes effective, 
all trades will be done with ONEOK LP under the ONEOK II Master Agreement 
that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes from the parent ONEOK Inc.    
We will let you know when this becomes effective.

The following are my answers to your questions:

1.  No.

2.  The nomination is at the pay meter 9862.

3.  In the past, this purchase has not been listed on the spreadsheet.  It has been 	      maintained by the Risk group.

4.  As of 4/24/01, Comstock's nomination is 43,681 and Kerr McGee's is 29,037.

5.  This purchase is not listed on the spreadsheet.  It is maintained separately on a file by Daren.  To the best of my knowledge it is a good wellhead purchase.

Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch 

In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of 
growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned 
a ""rating watch negative"" designation to the securities of California's two 
largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern 
California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In 
addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to ""F1"" from 
""F1+"". 

Fitch cited the need for ""significant and extensive regulatory decisions"" to 
resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate 
under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the ""watch 
negative"" status, the independent rating service expects to review the 
ratings within six months. 

A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said 
the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it ""underscores the 
seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties

relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 
30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of 
illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be 
collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). 

The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of 
$1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing 
under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through 
September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion 
collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the 
utilities' frozen retail rate levels. 

""While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery 
through rates is uncertain,"" Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative 
watch. ""Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison 
anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the 
end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002.

Kern River Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of Williams, said it planned on 
filing an application yesterday with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional 
firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The company 
said the California Expansion Project will not only provide additional 
natural gas capacity from Wyoming to markets in California, but also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on the recent approval by FERC of Kern River's 
Extended Term Rate Program. 

""A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system,"" said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. 

The project includes construction of three new compressor stations, an 
additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a 
compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. Kern River said the $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 

The company said demand for firm transportation on Kern River was driven by 
several factors: the diversion of Canadian gas supplies to markets in the 
Midwest from the Pacific region; increased production in the Rocky Mountain 
basin; strong economic growth in Kern River's market areas; and increased 
demand from gas-fired electric generation facilities. 

Williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to 
determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the Kern 
River pipeline. ""The demand for competitively priced transportation to 
markets in Nevada and California continues to grow. At the same time, gas 
producers in the Rocky Mountain basin are stepping up production. An 
expansion on Kern River in 2003 could help bring that production to market,"" 
said Morgan.

With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you 
turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large 
power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards 
distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big 
investment opportunity for the coming decade."" In Winters' 250 page report, 
""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: 
Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within 
the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage 
of the current situation. 

""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of 
new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this 
coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which 
flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in 
the early 1980's,"" said Winters. 

""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of 
high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters. According to his research, 
microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be 
able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. 

He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, 
efficient and very versatile. ""They can be used as a main power source, a 
back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in 
traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said. ""Microturbines can also be used 
in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access 
to electricity."" Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel 
requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other 
fuels as well. 

In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and 
existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and 
Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. 

In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed 
energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering 
flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading 
manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive."" The companies are in addition 
to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a 
buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral.

Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) finished off 2000 with a bang by completing 
three year-end asset transactions. First, the company finalized the $91 
million sale of natural gas liquid (NGL) pipeline assets to TEPPCO Crude 
Pipeline, L.P., then it completed the purchase of certain natural gas 
pipeline assets from El Paso Field Services in two separate deals for an 
undisclosed sum. 

The assets sold to TEPPCO include the Panola Pipeline and the San Jacinto 
Pipeline, both of which are NGL pipelines. Under the agreement, TEPPCO also 
agreed to take over the lease of a 34-mile condensate pipeline. The three 
pipelines included in the sale all originate at DEFS' East Texas Plant 
Complex located in Panola County, TX. 

""This sale underscores our strategy of growing earnings through our TEPPCO 
master limited partnership,"" said Jim Mogg, CEO of DEFS. ""In 2000, we almost 
doubled the distribution that DEFS received as the general partner of TEPPCO 
Partners, L.P., and at the same time increased the distribution to limited 
partnership unitholders."" 

In the second transaction, which the company completed on Dec. 28, 2000, DEFS 
acquired 100% of Gas Transmission Teco, Inc.'s common stock. The company owns 
interests in the 500-mile Teco intrastate natural gas pipeline in Texas, and 
was purchased from El Paso Field Services. 

Included in the assets, DEFS gained a 50% interest in the El Paso-operated 
West Texas Line which travels from Waha to New Braunfels, a 100% interest in 
the Guadalupe Line that travels from New Braunfels to Dewville, and a 50% 
interest in the MidTex Line from Dewville to Katy. DEFS also received several 
supply lines and related assets with the acquisition. 

DEFS said the lines combined have a 250 MMcf/d of natural gas capacity, and 
extend from Waha in West Texas to Katy. The company also noted that the lines 
interconnect five DEFS plants with a combined processing capacity of 640 
MMcf/d. 

""The timely addition of this strategic system provides DEFS with increased 
marketing opportunities for the gas from these plants,"" said Mogg. ""The lines 
also allow DEFS new access to the growing San Antonio/Austin corridor."" 

In DEFS' third end of the year transaction, the company acquired El Paso 
Field Services' 50% interest in the 265-mile San Jacinto natural gas 
pipeline. The transaction brings DEFS' ownership up to 100%. The San Jacinto 
line provides gas gathering and transportation services along the Texas Gulf 
Coast, with delivery to a third party and two DEFS gas processing plants. 

DEFS was formed last year when Duke Energy and Phillips Petroleum combined 
their natural gas gathering and processing businesses. Duke Energy holds a 
70% stake in the company while Phillips retains a 30% share.

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States."

FERC yesterday ordered El Paso Merchant Energy to stop stonewalling and turn 
over protected materials to parties involved in a complaint case in which 
it's alleged the affiliate received preferential treatment when it acquired 
1.2 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

Specifically, the Commission denied El Paso Merchant's request for rehearing 
of a June 2000 order that granted in part the discovery sought by the 
California Public Utilities Commission, and rejected rehearing of a September 
protective order. The latter directed El Paso Merchant to make available to 
all intervening parties, who agreed to the terms of the protective order, all 
of the materials that were being submitted to the CPUC and FERC in the case. 

So far, El Paso Merchant has refused to release the information to these 
parties, claiming the materials being filed with the CPUC and FERC are for 
""Government Eyes Only."" It also argues that the protective order offers 
inadequate protection of commercially sensitive information. 

The Commission disagreed. ""El Paso Merchant has not substantiated or 
sufficiently justified its broad claim that all of the 'protected materials' 
provided to CPUC and this Commission warrant the designation 'Government Eyes 
Only.' Indeed, all of the information that El Paso Merchant seeks to 
shield...relates directly to the issues,"" the order said [RP00-241]. Also, 
FERC finds that the protective order provides ""sufficient protection for El 
Paso Merchant's commercially sensitive documents."" 

The CPUC brought the complaint last April. It is seeking to abrogate the $38 
million contract arrangement between El Paso and El Paso Merchant. The agency 
alleges the affiliate was given ""preferential treatment"" by El Paso during 
the open season for the capacity, and thus the contract arrangement should be 
declared void. 

The CPUC and others contend the contract arrangement, which awarded more than 
one-third of El Paso's capacity rights to the California border to El Paso 
Merchant, is largely responsible for the high natural gas and electric prices 
in the state. They have urged FERC to ""act immediately"" on the merits of the 
complaint, but the Commission has yet to do so. 
"

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas 
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in 
Pennsylvania. 
The ""tentative"" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their 
downstream 
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be 
operating 
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and 
National 
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an 
investment 
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the ""greenfield"" Independence project over 
significant 
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they 
were not 
convinced the new precedent agreements provided ""sufficient evidence"" of 
market 
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at 
least 35% 
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

Kern River is holding an open season through Aug. 18 to determine interest in 
year-round FT to Nevada 
and California and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm 
shippers. The pipeline said it can 
offer significantly reduced FT rates based on recent FERC approval of Kern 
River's Extended Term 
Rate Program (ET Program). Under ET Program, customers could receive a rate 
reduction from $0.64/Dth 
to approximately $0.42 under a 15-year contract. Because system expansion can 
be accomplished by the 
addition of compression facilities, it could result in an overall lowering of 
rolled-in rates for all shippers, Kern 
River said. Depending on open season results, the pipeline is proposing a 
mainline expansion of up to 500 
MMcf/d with an in-service target date of May 1, 2002. If goals can be met 
using relinquished capacity and no 
new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as Oct. 1, 
2001. Call Laurie Brown at

Energy Insight News for Thursday, September 20, 2001:


Expectations fall for Canada's natural gas 'frontier'

Canada's arctic north may not be North America's next big natural
gas-producing basin after all. 

In what one geologist said was a ""major, major"" reduction in estimated
natural gas potential, the Canadian Gas Potential Committee-a volunteer
group of 50 geologists and other professionals who assess Canada's
undiscovered gas potential-last week reported that Canada's frontier basins,
which include the arctic and Mackenzie Delta regions, may hold no more than
60 to 65 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas that ultimately could make it to
market. 

The new estimate falls short of previous estimates that 300 to 400 tcf of
gas could be found in the Beaufort Basin, the arctic islands and Mackenzie
corridor. It was those estimates that helped encourage geologists, producers
and a number of U.S.-based power plant developers to consider the north as
almost a second Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Gas from that
historically prolific yet now declining basin makes up around 15% of U.S.
imports. 

""We thought the gas was greener,"" said Rob Woronuk, a senior analyst with
the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. 

Still more potentially bad news came from the committee's report. 

In what Woronuk said was an ""embarrassment,"" the committee has now decided
that Canadian coalbed methane may have less of a role to play than was
previously thought. 

The committee reversed the findings of its 1997 report that estimated
coalbed methane could account for up to 270 tcf of Canada's overall 570 tcf
natural gas resource.

Title: One Tight Winter Peak Remains 	

***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGYWINTER DEMAND PEAKS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PRICE SPIKES OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS

Building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western 
energy markets for this winter. Although seasonal gas and power demand spikes 
will again push prices higher, this winter will not look like the winter of 
2000/01. Unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last 
year winter, reduced demand, increased gas storage levels, and new gas and 
power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the 
risk of supply disruptions. 

*  A supply build of 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the Rockies and 
900 MMcf in western Canada is meeting with declining demand in the West

*  Fourth quarter power demand is expected to be 13 percent below levels last 
year, while over 5,000 megawatts of new supply has been added this year

*  Only severe cold weather, prolonged drought, or a supply disruption could 
produce a reliability problem this winter

Kinder Morgan, Inc. announced plans to contribute $300 million in assets to 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., the company's master limited 
partnership. The largest asset to be contributed is Kinder Morgan Texas 
Pipeline, formerly MidCon Texas, a 2,600-mile natural gas pipeline system 
that extends from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. 

Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing 
Systems, KMI's 50% interest in Coyote Gas Treating and KMI's 25% interest in 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. As consideration for the assets, KMI will receive 
$300 million, 50% in cash and 50% in KMP partnership units. KMI expects the 
transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. 

""This transaction represents a true win-win for both KMI and KMP,"" said 
Kinder Morgan CEO Rich Kinder. ""It is expected to be accretive to cash 
available for distribution to KMP's unitholders by between 5-10 cents in 
2001. The pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP because they complement 
existing KMP assets, have long-term contracts in place and offer significant 
growth opportunities."" Kinder noted that because the mix of consideration 
paid will include equity issued to KMI, it will not be necessary to raise 
funds for the transaction via a public offering of KMP units. 

""KMI will also benefit from the transaction, as it will be able to reduce its 
debt by $150 million,"" Kinder said. ""Additionally, the transaction is 
expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share in 2001. By 
increasing its stake in the master limited partnership, KMI will enjoy 
greater participation in the expected future growth of KMP."" 

Upon closing, KMP will have completed in excess of $600 million of 
acquisitions in 2000. In addition, this transaction will boost KMI's total 
asset contribution to KMP to more than $1 billion, far exceeding the original 
goal stipulated when Kinder Morgan merged with KN Energy last July. "

Oneok is okay with our form of guarantee, they do not want to make any changes to our form.  As a result they requested that we issue said guarantee, the relevant information is listed below.

I met with Roger Westbrook on Friday about the Bridgeline easements.  We figured out what info we already have and what we still need.  Attached is an email from Roger to Joel Milliet from Bridgeline regarding what we still need.  

I am working with Roger on putting together the ROW agreement.  I will send it to you for review once we were are done.  Roger is out of town this week so you can probably expect something from us by the middle of next week.

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this.  I have sent an email to David Owen about the hazardous waste question.  I will let you know what he says.  However, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we want to make any warranties about potential hazardous waste sources on the property.  At the most, we could make a warranty about the fact, if true, that we have never used the property in such a manner.  David Owen should be able to tell us a little more about the uses of the property.  

As far as Item #3 below is concerned, do you know if we have done a title search on the property?  If we need to do a title search, there is a guy in Louisiana that can do it for us.  If we know there is a discrepancy in the chain of title, is there a way to nullify the latest transfer between LRPC to LRCI.  

Let me know what you think.  If you think it is necessary to meet to discuss these points, please let me know.

I just spoke with Tina Horn from the Cameron Parish.  They received the letter voiding the original agreement.  She said that since using it for potable water was the only use they had in mind, they won't be needing the ROA to the pipeline.  (Actually, she told me that their engineer had told them that it would be possible to clean the pipeline to the point that it could be used for potable water.)

Just to let you know, I scheduled a meeting with Roger Westbrook on this Thursday, Sept 27 at 2 pm.  If it's okay with you, we can just meet in your office at that time.

The two main issues to discuss are the plat and legal description for Sorrento and the Bridgeline-Crawfish agreement.

Please let me know if this doesn't work for you.

Talk to you soon,

Page 13 of the Sorrento ROW agmt has only one line on it ""Exhibit 'B' of LRCI Grant of Servitude of Right of Use for Pipeline Agreement""

Should that be in there or can we delete that page?

The contact information for Assumption Parish is as follows:

Attn: Kim Torres
P.O. Box 524
Napoleonville, LA 70390

I have two changes that you may have already taken note of.  The first change is in the description of the property on the first page.  In the 8th line in the description, it says ""the South property line a distance or 260.02...""  it should read ""distance of 260.02"".  This change also needs to be made in the description contained within Exhibit B.  In the description contained within Exhibit B, there should not be a period after the words ""to the point of beginning"" in the 10th line.  

The second change is also in Exhibit B on page 2.   In the paragraph that starts ""all parties signing the written instrument...."", I don't think ""marital status"" should be in there.   

One final thing, the purchase price for the warehouse and land is $100,000.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.  Also, let me know if you need any help with the lawn-mowing agreement.

The name of the guy in Lafayette, LA who can do a title search for us if we need him to is Art LeBlanc, (337) 233-9099.  However you would like to handle it is fine with me. 

Like I mentioned on the phone, Roger Westbrook is the one helping with the ROWs that Bridgeline is requesting on the Crawfish land.  He indicated some time back that he had received some of the drawings from Bridgeline.  If needed, I can set up a meeting with Roger once we know the status of the documents.  

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help on either of these.

1. Are there any ""credit terms"" that need to be disclosed at this point?  
Should it be made subject to credit terms?  Should we mention that these 
swaps will be documented under an ISDA Master Agreement with schedules to be 
negotiated or will the swps be done under the existing Master Agreement that 
we have with Olympic?

2. In Section A, I am not familiar with the ""EnronOnline 1-2 month bid price, 
but I'm assuming that one of our businerss people has taken a look at this 
wording and is okay with it.

Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 
from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. (""Guarantor"") for the benefit of 
Enron North America Corp. (""Enron"").  By letter addressed to you dated April 
6, 2000 (the ""Termination Letter""), Guarantor terminated its obligations 
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such 
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty 
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the 
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 
6 to read as follows:  ""This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date 
being the ""Termination Date"") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) 
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as 
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written 
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such 
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as 
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by 
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such 
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect 
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the 
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the 
terms of this Guaranty.""

Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the

We plan to meet with these guys directly and through NIC (they have strong relationship with Tohoku) in the very near future to talk about other coal based derivatives and structures (Sydney is involved).  This effort was already underway before this announcement.  I met the President of Tohoku about two weeks ago and indicated possible opportunities.  We are trying to repair relationships here as EPower's major (and premature) announcements at the beginning of the year pissed them off to no end.

I have attached a presentation that outlines our current analysis concerning TOCOM and the other markets in Japan.  This presentation should be looked at as linked to the presentation concerning Nissho Iwai sent out last Wednesday.  I would suggest that you look at the other presentation first.  NIC helps provide us with the local market insight that would take real time for us to develop on our own.  I believe that the local trading markets are interesting and worth Enron moving forward with.  What you will see as you look at these presentations is in fact a call for an overall Asian strategy for EGM.

The following attached documents are the draft MOU (still rough) and a summary of the document.  We have not yet showed either of these to Sato, but would plan to do so early next week.  We met with Freshfields for 2 hours the other day to get some basic thoughts and to gauge their interest in helping to draft the JV agreement.  They thought our MOU could be more simple and while I don't completely disagree, I'd like to make sure Sato is 90-95% there before we bring their senior guy(s) to Houston.  Regardless, we need to run both of you through where we are today and plans for the next couple of weeks.  I have a meeting and dinner with Nakatani (head of corp planning and guy who would sign MOU tomorrow).  From all indications it looks as though things are still on track.  There still are a number of items still to work out, but some of these might be deliberately left blank in the MOU.

Jeff:  I had traded voice mails with Mike about (among other things) having a conference call at 5:30 pm your Thurs (0730 Friday Tokyo).  I am not sure if this is confirmed, but pls let us know if this works or an alternative time.

Location - at a fire station in a Hispanic Community - exact location will be 
forwarded shortly but estimated distance from ENE office = less than 15 min.

Expect News Conference to last a total of 30 minutes, including Q&A. Jeff 
Skilling will be spokesperson for Selection Committee. However, we will try 
to have as many committee members present as possible. 

Mayor will likely discuss (estimated time = 10 min.):
 - changes that are required at HFD - potential need to bring in an outsider, 
etc...
 - reasoning behind involvement of Enron/Jeff Skilling & formation of 
selection committee - de-politicize the process, etc...

JS should speak about the following (estimated time = 10-15 min.):
 - how he became involved in the process
 - how the committee members were selected
 - who the members are with a brief background on each (We plan to provide a

"" Heart scare sends Bob Lanier to hospital""

Summary:
Lanier's defibrillator went off
wife called 911
first responder fire engine at the scene in 6 min
SUV arrived 2 min later, or within 8 min of call
""estimated"" arrival time of an ambulance, 2 min later, or within 10 min of 
call - both of the City's downtown ambulances were at hospitals on other calls
Mayor Brown gave the okay to transport Lanier to hospital in SUV

Implications:
Not enough ambulances downtown and Mayor has plans to close both downtown 
fire stations with a temporary station to cover the downtown area until new 
station built (3-5 years)
purpose of SUVs is to free paramedics from transporting patients to hospital 
so can respond to EMS calls more quickly (not to mention that SUVs are not 
equipped to transport a patient)

  Diana has asked that we let her know whenever we have variances, disputes, or make changes to any deals concerning these two counterparties Tacoma and Seattle City Light from today forward.  

  I suggest that we querry weekly for these 2 counterparties in DMS and provide Diana with a PMA report from DMS so that she can read any Settlements and VM comments in DMS about the deal and ask questions accordingly.

  Thanks,

virginia.thompson@enron.com|"

Here are a couple of things I've thought of that will make it easier for me to research deals when there is a dispute.  Please discuss whatever necessary with the traders to help me improve the speed and accuracy of my research. 

1.) All notebooks need to have clear and accurate dates in them.  Notebooks with no dates at all or random dates are useless for me without the traders' interpretation.

2.) Can we have the traders leave their notebooks here at all times?  I often find notebooks and logs missing for whatever reason.  

3.) One thing that is getting better is the accuracy of the Inc sheets, however, I still sometimes find that the trader's notes and the Inc sheets or the El Paso Model don't match.  At that point, I don't know which one to go by.  I need to be sure that I can trust the accuracy of the Inc sheets as the end-all.

4.) Please make sure that all real-time deals or real-time extended deals are getting routed.  I've come across a number of deals that are not routed and this makes it hard for me to know if my research is accurate.  It also makes it hard for me to change the other side of a deal that requires changes.

5.) Please make sure that all deals get recorded and scheduled.  I've seen a few deals that are in the traders' notebooks, but that haven't been entered in EnPower.  You know the result.

6.) CUTS (need I say more) ...are a mess.  I really really need to see notes on every cut!!!!!  This means notes on the cut sheets or in the lotus notes database AND notes in deal scheduling ! 
When a schedule is cut and the trader has been informed of the cut, I need to see this cut made in deal scheduling with a note.  Many of my DMS's could have been avoided if the trader had made the cut in EnPower (this means I found a note regarding the cut but no further action had been taken to record this in EnPower).  I specifically need to see the following for every cut schedule:  Where did resupply come from (deal # too)?  Was it a bookout (deal # too)?  What's the resupply price?  Who at the counterparty did our trader talk to?  What is the reason for the cut?  And please initial your notes so that if I have a question about them, I know who to ask.
You can never make too many notes!!

One thing to remember is that Deal Entry, Deal Scheduling, and Lotus Notes do not communicate with each other, so though it is a grueling task, every transaction and all notes have to be entered in at least 2 places.  (it's called copy and paste)

If we can keep these things in mind, I think we will have fewer disputes in the future.  And when we do have disputes, I'll be able to figure them out in a more timely manner.  

Thanks for your attention to these things.  I look forward to bugging you less in the future.

Thanks for your response.  It appears that we sent EES the wrong prices in 
the spreadsheet that we sent to them.  Bill said he would make the changes, 
so I won't bring this over to you (not yet anyway).   I also told Mark in 
Houston what is happening, so this will hopefully be done.

Dear Traders:

  Please be advised that the following worksheet is an estimated summary of transmission ancillary charges.  These charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them.  To figure approximately how much each MW of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied, use the following worksheet, adding each of the 4 ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost.

  For example:  

   I reserve 55 MW's of Sierra Pacific transmission.
 
  Scheduling Fees:   			(55 MW's x 0.1649) =   9.07
  Reactive Supply and Voltage fees: 	9.1692 x (0.45 x 55) x 0.0234 = 5.31
  Line Losses:				0.0234 x 55 MW's x (anticipate average energy cost so far this month; circa $45) = 57.92
				**Please note that if energy prices are higher, this line loss charge will be higher too;  ie - if prices are at $300, this charge will be 386.10**
 
   TOTAL ANCILLARY:			$ 72.30 for 55 MW's  = $ 1.315 per MW hour of transmission


   

Attached is the worksheet:

                             
Please ask me if you have any questions.

We are having the same problem with Montana Power's checkout as we had last month: the volume of disputes is overwhelming!!

I have looked at the Inc sheets and found that EnPower matches the Inc. sheets.
But in fairness to MPC's disputes, last month when I trusted the Inc sheets, and I pulled the tapes, I found that our Inc. sheets were wrong in a number of places.

Mike and I are doing the March 2001 checkout and are having trouble finding your logs, your notebooks, or any information regarding the dates in question.

I am listing below the dates and HE that we are having disputes for.  Please look at your logs and let me know the MW value, price, and who you spoke to at MPC at what time.  Please do not give me what the Inc sheets say, as Mike and I have already looked at them.

 I spoke with Don at Public Service Company of New Mexico again today regarding the Schedule 9 Loss Compensation Service charges.  He re-confirmed that the market price that is part of the Schedule 9 equation (Loss Compensation Service = # MW wheeled x market price x 3%) is a market price that he obtains from his marketers.  I re-confirmed that his 'marketers' are his traders, though I do not know whether these are Long Term, Cash, or Real-Time Traders.

 He is going to talk to his traders to find out where this price came from.  I brought up the point that there has been a price cap of $91.87 in the west and asked that he bring that point forward in his discussions.  

 He should respond to me on Monday 8-20-01, on which day the bill is due.

 I will keep you posted on my findings.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and

and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.

If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your

I think Webb and I will need to schedule a game (which will be difficult).    
After that, it looks like we would play the aggies this weekend or next.

It is uncertain if AC will be party these games."
michael.simmons@enron.com|"

I'm very disappointed with the way this whole situation has been mishandled.  
I can't speak as to what occurred on the Anderson side, but these are my 
thoughts on this situation.

1.  All the Enron captains (including the Aggies) agreed to play Saturday 
regardless of the weather.  I confirmed that we would be on as rain and cold 
weather were very likely to occur.  Had the other captains decided to not 
play in the cold rain, we could have rescheduled the game for  Sunday or an 
alternative day.

2.  My understanding is that the Aggies called the game  (Billy Lemmons and 
Ted Bland) and then changed the awarding of the tickets in way that directly 
benefitted the Aggie teams.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but neither Billy nor 
Ted were out at the field to judge the weather conditions prior to calling 
off the game.  Nor were the captains contacted for their input.   The rules 
have been abitrarily changed in mid-stream to the advantage of the Aggies and 
this is grossly unfair.   The top 2 fund raisers for the Enron Aggie teams 
were to be awarded footballs that were autograped by the Aggie football 
team.   Given this additional  incentive, it's not surprising that they 
raised more money than the UT teams  (by my unofficial estimates).  By one 
estimate who was familiar with the aggie fund rainsing efforts, one team 
raised about $2,000 and the other raised about $5,000. 

So what do we do about this situation?   It's up to you to decide if you want 
to play  in the rescheduled tournament.  Personally, I don't see much point 
nor motivation to play.  It surely won't be for bragging rights, as the real 
UT/a&m game will have already occurred.  In addition, I think it would be 
appropriate to give the people who donated funds the option to get their 
money back.   The situation that now exists is not what I raised money for.  

I want to thank you all for the work and effort you put forth for this event, 
it's unfortunate that it wasn't handled better.

I will be out all of next week.  Leave me a voicemail if you need to speak 
to  me.   I will have your shirts on the Monday following Thanksgiving."
michael.simmons@enron.com|"

Dress accordingly to stay warm and dry.       I would recommend that you buy 
a cheap plastic poncho, preferrably see-through (at walmart for $2 or less).
Be prepared for whatever the weather has to offer..

Bring your cleats  (no metal cleats) for traction.   If you need cleats,  
Oshman's has good Riddell football shoes for $20 to $35.

Finally, today is the last day to get donations...   so  get  'em..

Goal Line Isolation




DESCRIPTION

Line up in a Trips Right formation.  Have inside receiver run a five 
yardpost, drawing coverage from the middle zone defender.  The middle 
receiver will run an eight yard curl.  The outside receiver will run a 
delayed slant.  Most of the coverage should be moving left.  The running back 
will delay, then run up the middle to the back of the end zone, then dart to 
the right, the QB will delay and sprint right also. The defense will be 
moving left and should be a step behind.  If the QB can sprint to the end 
zone, a lane may be open, or else the RB should be open. 

QB : The quarterback should initally delay for a split second before 
sprinting to his right. quarterback can make a good head fake to the left or 
look at his receivers on the left before . He should run the ball into the 
end zone if it is open or throw the ball to his running . The quarterback 
should run the ball if the defense is out of , even if the running back is 
open. This will eliminate the chance of a incomplete pass or .

RB : The running back should initially delay for a split second to give a 
block for the quarterback. This will allow the play to develop and keep the 
defense from worrying about the RB. The RB then runs forward to the back of 
the end zone and makes a sharp cut to the right before going out of bounds. 
Make sure the running back stays around the back of the end zone so the 
quarterback can throw the ball over the defenders head if need be.

Other Players : The other players should do their best to draw the defense 
towards the left side of the field.

==================================

Center Hook and Ladder


DESCRIPTION

Line up with twins to the left; one blocker on the left of center; one WR on 
the right and a RB to the left of QB

RB: go in short motion to the left; make a loop patern on outside of the 
""twins"" who should block for him. The RB is secondary receiver.

Right WR: Do a 5-yard button hook to inside.

QB: Throw to right WR.

Right WR: Lateral ball to the center who after the snap should be moving 
parallel to line of scrimmage, about 2-3 yards down field.

Center: Receive lateral and run option with QB who should stay in 
pitch-relationship after he throws the ball.

QB: If the hook isn't open, hit the RB or run for it.

Left Guard: Block 


QB : The quarterback needs to first read the defense. If the right receiver 
can beat the coverage then look the defenders off and deliver a good quick 
pass to the receiver. The receiver should be able to use his body to shield 
the defender. If the defense is in good position to stop the pass call an 
audible or be prepared to throw the ball to your secondary receiver (RB). As 
soon as the quarterback throws the ball he needs to immediately get into 
position to receive the pitch from his center. The quarterback will most 
likely have to be running full speed right after he throws the ball so he can 
be in a good pitch relation with his center. Make sure the quarterback never 
stops running with the center.

Right WR: The right receiver needs to run full speed off the line of 
scrimmage to push his defender back. As soon as he gets about 5-yards down 
the field he should curl in towards the quarterback and use his body to 
shield the defender. Make sure the receiver knows to knock the ball down if 
the quarterback makes a bad pass. As soon as the receiver catches the ball he 
should immediately pitch the ball to his center. Don't be in too big of a 
hurry. If the pitch isn't there the receiver should turn the ball up field 
for as many yards as possible or try to get the pitch to his quarterback. 
Don't pitch the ball to the other team. 

Center: The center will run 2-3 yards forward then drag the line of scrimmage 
left to right. The center should be running at a medium speed until the 
receiver catches the ball. This will allow the receiver to get a good handle 
on the ball before pitching it. The center should be on the inside of the 
receiver and must be prepared to give a quick pitch to the quarterback. If 
there is a defender between the center and the quarterback, the center should 
fake the pitch and continue up field.

Other Players : The other players need to follow the routes on the play 
diagram so they force the defenders to the opposite side of the field. The RB 
should always be ready for the pass. He is the secondary receiver and needs 
to be able to bail the quarterback out of trouble.

Caution : This play requires practice and flawless execution. Timing is 
Crucial.

We would like to have a scrimmage/practice with your team this Wednesday.    
The aggie teams have already held practice as of Sunday and are scrimmaging 
this Wednesday as well  (to which we are not invited).   As they pose the 
greatest hurdle to obtaining the tickets, it is essential that we prepare in 
similar fashion.....

However, we are unable to find a LIGHTED field to practice upon (Memorial is

 extra pts.   1  from 3 yd line,,  2pts from 10 yrd line

Games are 2, 20 minute halves with a 7 play rule at the end of the 20 
minutes... 7 plays occur after the 20 minutes...


the Enron teams play first at  10 am  and then we have a 1 hour break...

the AC teams play at 11 and then play again at 12 against us..

so the AC teams will be tired.   

The next game follows at 1 pm, the game against the Enron aggies (most 
likely) for the tickets.

===

As soon as we get into the lead on the first game and cover whatever bets we 
make with Webb  (a 17 pt lead in the first half ends the game)..   the top 
players should take a break  (eric, paul, and stephen, alternatively should 
take a break on offense, and Luis should sit  out on defense)

This is especially important for the game against AC, which should be an 
easier game.   As soon as we get a 1 to 2 touchdown lead, the top players 
should rest.

Last year our team was pretty tired going into the final game and with good 
time management we can lower our chances of key injuries and tired players..

==

Eric if you have time,  throw some more plays together... perhaps some more 
option,  pick off pass routes, reverses,  pitches to a back who passes to the 
QB, etc...  indicate what the line/center should do for these run plays...

finally, Saturday morning lets take 5-10 minutes to go over defensive 
assignments and go over how zone works... and who is responsible for what.. 
so that we're all on the same page."

make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in 
the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's 
prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. 


If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as the tennis courts...

Attached is the revised 4th Qtr Forecast Summary.

Also, attached is the expense analysis I did.  Please note, I did not include UAF.

I have compared our actual numbers with James' spreadsheet and Steve Kleb's earnings model.  Once I made that adjustment for the $244 reserve in August on James' spreadsheet, we are all in agreement that the YTD actuals for TW commercial is $162.7.  I have also verified that number with Robert Miller and he agrees that is the number reflected on the Income Statement.

The $244 reserve reversal was made in September and reflected in the transport margins revenues.

Here are the answers to questions 1, 2, & 4:

1.  What percent of TW's volumes transported during the 3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001 was firm
     vs. interruptible?


		   	       	            2000 			            2001
  				July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
IT Percentage			.09	.09	.09	 	.10	.08	.07
Firm Percentage		.91	.91	.91		.90	.92	.93


2.  What percent of TW's pipe capacity was used during  3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001? 
 
		   			2000 			            2001
West flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.90	.95	.97 	 	 100	 100	 .91


		   			2000 			            2001
East flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.81	.85	.86	 	 100	 100	 .91

4.    On James Weitekamp's ""ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights"" schedule, transport 
      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001.  This doesn't 
      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not.  Why does this difference
      exist?
 
     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing 
     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increased from East to East because 
     pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter.

Just wanted to give him a look at where we are since we did not do a Weekly last week.
Please review and if it is OK I will give it to Steve.

I am not familiar with the deal, but if the path is something different than East of Thoreau to Calif, the fuel rate is above max which I would think would qualify is as a neg rate transaction.  I would suggest talking to Teb Lokey regarding the actual filing as his shop will be making this filing.

In BP Energy's Red Rock contract #27609, BP has certain termination rights if TW defaults on certain obligations.  So that everyone is aware of the rights and obligations of both parties, they are stated below.


Transwestern must certify to BP by December 31, 2001 or such date as the parties may agree upon, that Transwestern has received acceptable licenses, permits (except air permits), approvals, right-of-way interests and utilities for construction and operation of the Red Rock Expansion.  If this condition is not met, or otherwise waived by the parties, BP shall have the right upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, exercised no later than sixty (60) days after December 31, 2001 to terminate the agreement.

Transwestern must certify to BP by March 31, 2002 that Transwestern has received acceptable air permits.  If this condition is not met, or otherwise waived by the parties, BP shall have the right upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, exercised no later than sixty (60) days after March 31, 2002 to terminate the agreement.

Just to follow up.

Ron and I discussed this some more and decided that we should file re 
condition #3 which could be read to allow the utilities to use a third 
party's credit standing without that parties' permission.  As you noticed, it 
was very difficult to discern what was going on with that language as 
drafted.  

The filing is due tomorrow.

Joe, Ray and others:

This is in response to a compliance filing made by the ISO w.r.t. FERC's 2/14

followed intense pressure not only from California Gov. Gray Davis
and Democrats newly in charge of the Senate but also from House
Republicans worried that spiraling power prices in the West could
affect the 2002 election.
    FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert said the order, effective through
September 2002, will benefit consumers but also will ``provide
every incentive for suppliers to reduce costs.''
    The order expands price restrictions the agency imposed in April
on wholesale electricity sales in California during peak demand
periods when blackouts were threatened.

A bunch of filings on Thursday is next.

I asked Jim if Joe Hartsoe needs to sign off on each filing no matter how 
small. He said that there is no hard and fast rule  use good judgement 
basically.  Joe needs to know about each filing.  He should be given time to 
review the bigger pleadings, but for smaller ones a heads up may be all that 
is necessary.  Hope this helps.

NOTE:  The ISO's Gen Counsel would not respond to a reporter's question 
asking if he gave confidential data to other state agencies.  I guess we can 
assume that means the ISO has done that.

The ISO has calculated its view of what a competitive price is for several 
months:

Jan  $180/MWh
Feb  $260/MWh

CA ISO is filing jointly with SCE and SDG&E.  The comments begin with a tyrade that FERC has no right to condition price caps on joining an RTO.  Apparently, they weakly support regional organizations and note agreement to work with the other RTOs that are now forming.

PG&E is filing separate comments ""because of its bankruptcy."" PG&E will note concern about the CA ISO ""independence"" and talks about other RTOs as potentially good options.

The CPUC ordered and berated PG&E to file its comments with the CPUC BEFORE submitting them to FERC.  PG&E initially protested, but was threatened with fines.  It finally filed yesterday under seal.

Bottomline:

I believe that the joint ISO/IOU filing is structured to provide the minimal needed to meet the FERC test. Therefore, FERC's price caps will remain in effect.

SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.

Opposition to ISO Compliance Filing On Creditworthiness Standards
The ISO made a compliance filing that greatly expands its creditworthiness 
exemptions, far beyond what FERC had ordered in its 2/14/01 order.  The ISO's 
tariff language can be read to allow the utilities to count the credit status 
of third parties as their own, without the third parties' approvals.  Enron 
will oppose.  The filing is due 3/22/01.

Also Bracewell is making or has made the following CA filings (these are all 
I know about anyway):

Tucson Electric Complaint   Intervention  vanilla 3/19   Done for Sanders 
 no RCR
PNM Complaint   Support   3/22 Done for Sanders  no RCR
FERC Staff Report  Support EPSA/WPTF 3/22 Plan to do for <$500
      and raise temporal issue of western resources
City of San Diego  Intervene/comment 3/28 Probably will be done for Sanders

The underscheduling filing was put on hold.  We were mistaken when we thought 
that comments on an ISO proposal were due 3/22.   Instead, we've now decided 
to file comments in response to the ISO's filing of tariff changes, which 
should be made soon.

That's all for the rest of March, so far.  I'll be updating Jim's table on 
pending FERC matters.

Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.

Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.

I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.

The suggested amount for you/Enron is $200,00012.5% of the total.  Enron 
gave $50,000 for the 2000 effort, which was about 8% of the total they ended 
up raising ($617,000).   it is your call on what is reasonable, and keep in

I have invited the following individuals to join us at the 3 pm Thursday 
meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas 
situation.

Hamd AlhkayatHamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be 
helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's 
speeches.

Shelley CormanShelley has been developing messages for the current and 
anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group.  
(The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.)

Stinson GibnerStinson is with the research group that has generated some of 
the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic 
futures pricing.

Gil MuhlGil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.  
His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter 
volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
meeting.

Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
overview of the situation as the ""teacher"" or ""professor.""  Some questions 
that you could address would include:

Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?

How is the business different today?

What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?

I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
before and after your keynote is that you have ""been there"" in the evolution 
of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to 
stress the need for new industry ""best practices"" (more hedging) and the 
right public policies to deal with this issue (from ""do no harm"" to expanding 
incentives in the market).

The attached one pager describes an embryonic idea for a new philanthropy 
venture that might be of interest for your panel discussion with Michael Dell 
at the Fortune conference on October 12th.

It is inspired by the populist arguments on the campaign trail against 
partial social security privatization.  I believe that if a greater number of 
Americans were corporate investors there would be a greater buy in to not 
only social security reform but to sound economic policies.  I also believe 
that redistributionist arguments would carry less weight.

luncheon and speech at the Hyatt Downtown in the Lay Lecture Series.

Barton Smith of UH will share the results of the economic study he is 
co-directing on the costs and benefits of the Houston region complying with 
the TNRCC SIP for ozone.  (This is the Greater Houston Partnership study I

also be present for the question and answer period.

I will give you more information as the event approaches.

The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the 
total benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently 
proposed) are below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad 
air days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are 
around $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including 
the assumption of today's best technology but no more.  The high costs 
include a ""last mile"" problem that the proposal of the Partnership's Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight 
construction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and 
future permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).

The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not 
eliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the 
current SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000about a 
1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This ""shock"" will be around 
one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 
according to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) 
is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.

It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election 
over), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's 
office and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal 
unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the 
study next month.

As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a 
top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are 
considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not 
intended to be a ""whining"" study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
(naturally) bring into review some ""last mile"" problems where certain SIP 
measures are the least cost effective.

These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
in and should not be shared externally.

The NAESB Bylaws include minimum requirements for meeting attendance of Board and EC members.  The requirements are the same for Board and EC reps.  Members must attend, in person, at least 25% of scheduled meetings and must participate in at least 75% of such meetings.  Attendance will be reviewed each March 31 and September 30 for the preceding twelve months.

The 2002 meeting schedule has not been finalized (neither dates nor locations).  In the past, all Board meetings and most EC meetings have been held in Houston.  For NAESB, this will change.  For 2002, none of the Board meetings will be in Houston and possibly none of the EC meetings will be in Houston.  Starting in June the EC meetings will probably move to two-day meetings (as they were in the past) because more than one quadrant may be in attendance.  New standards will be brought before the EC for vote.  New quadrants will probably have a flurry of new standards  hopefully not to the extent we had at the beginning of GISB.  Below is the meeting schedule as I know it thus far:

BOARD
March 7 - Washington D.C.
June 28 - TBD
Sept 18 - Baltimore, MD
Nov 21 - TBD

EC
Feb 21 - FP&L in Palm Beach, Florida
April 18 - TBD
June 13 - Boeing in Seattle, WA
Aug 8 - TBD
Oct 17 - Phoenix, AZ (tentative)
Dec 12  looking for host in New York, NY

The Board still has some transition issues to address, but I think a good deal of the transition has been taken care of.  For a while issues will continue to arise as we move through our processes, such as the one regarding GISB Operating Practices that I mentioned in my last update e-mail.

Activity in the EC slowed almost to a stop due in part to the Order 637 work being done by various subcommittees.  This held up the work on requests.  BPS has only a few requests on their plate.  In January, IR should finalize their work on Order 637 and resume work on their backlog of requests.  ETS has approximately 30 requests submitted to GISB; most are in IR.

One thing to watch for in the EC is standards that spill over into the wholesale gas quadrant from other quadrants.  If a standard is being adopted by another quadrant, EC reps in our quadrant can decide that the standard should apply to our quadrant as well.  The vote needed to have our quadrant address the standard is simple majority, which does not require support by the pipeline segment.  The final adoption of the standard requires a 17/2 vote.

New NAESB procedures may also be raised by other quadrants that affect adoption of standards or the organization as a whole.  These would be addressed by either the Board or the EC, depending on the nature of the procedure.

Thanks,

GISB Standard 2.3.41 states that imbalance trading should be allowed through at least the 17th business day of the month.  The language of the standard is as follows:

""Standard 2.3.41  Transportation Service Providers should provide the ability to post and trade imbalances until at least the close of the seventeenth business day of the month.""

This timing will need to be incorporated into the timeline.

In addition to the usual comments, the FERC is requesting comments on whether they should adopt the revisions to the capacity release timeline (5.3.2).  I spoke with Joe Hartsoe.  I feel we should comment in favor of adopting 5.3.2.  The timing is preferable to the FERC's findings in the CIG order, etc.  Parties such as the LDCs (Mike Novak) may see this as an opportunity to renege on the consensus agreements made in GISB.

Most of the pipeline EC reps are still out for the holidays  I haven't been able to find out whether they will comment.  I'll work on this next week.

The FERC is also proposing to eliminate existing section 284.12(a), which deals with EBBs.  They've noted this is clean-up of the regulations.  Similar requirements for Internet communications are contained in other regs.  I'll check the regs and let you know what I find.  There probably won't be any need to comment on this.

Comments are due February 1.  Nancy Bagot will coordinate our comments.  I'll work with her.  Implementation date is three months after a final rule is issued.

Section 18.1 of the bylaws states that quadrant procedures can be amended by majority vote of the Directors representing that quadrant.  Rae and Jay believe this is a mistake and needs to be changed.  There will be other items in the bylaws that need to be corrected.  Jay is keeping a list of inconsistencies / errors that are discovered.  If we find errors, we should send them to Rae to be added to the list.  She suggested the new Parliamentary Committee address the list  possibly after NAESB has been up and running for one year.

A vote will be taken to change the version 1.5 'GISB' standards to 'NAESB' standards.  There's been some discussion on the proper way to vote (e.g., 17/2, procedural).  It will probably be a 17/2 vote.  I don't think it matters.  The only issue I see is that people will want to make it clear that this 17/2 vote should not be interpreted as a vote in favor of each and every standard.  It is only a vote in favor of changing the standards to NAESB.  A comment can be made on the record.

The 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas' will be voted.  We have not been involved with or concerned about this document since we will not use it.  If a motion is made to accept it, I plan to vote in favor.  Comments have been submitted and it appears that this recommendation may be sent back to subcommittee for further work.  I'll go along with this if motioned.

Last December the EC adopted revisions to standards based on the recommendations in the Sandia Labs Report.  These revisions have been incorporated into GISB's response document, which has been distributed to the EC.  This response document was received earlier this week; I have not verified GISB's work.  This item is not on the EC agenda, so I don't know the specific intent.  They may want the EC to approve the final version  which means approving GISB's work.  I have a concern with that type of vote.  They may want the EC to approve the 'Executive Summary' and 'Conclusion' (total 3 pages).  I have no problem with that vote except that these documents have not been updated since the December revisions were made and are no longer correct.  I'll take care of during the EC meeting.  (NOTE: The revisions to standards have not been distributed for ratification.)

The plan is to bring the response document before the Board at their March meeting for ""approval"".  The response should also be reviewed by the Editorial Review Board.


Thanks,

ADDITIONAL NAESB BOARD NOTES
During the Board meeting, a Provisional Activity was moved to the active section of the annual plan.  The intent was to only move the partial day recall order.  However, the provisional item included two FERC orders  related to partial day recalls and affiliates.  I couldn't hear the discussion, but have been informed that the affiliate order was not mentioned and that the entire item was moved.  This needs to be corrected so the affiliate order is not on NAESB's annual plan.  I'll work with the EC reps to determine how we want to handle.  Your suggestions are welcome.
Per NAESB's Certificate, a Board member cannot have a substitute at a Board meeting.  During yesterday's meeting, Jack Hawks sat in and VOTED for his boss, Lyn Maddox (Services - PG&E Energy Trading).  Jack has been very involved in the Wholesale Electric Quadrant.  Immediately after the meeting, Boswell and Jay Costan were questioned about this voting.  Jay stated it is allowed per NAESB governance, but then determined it is not.  After some dancing and backpedaling, they noted that the resolution would go out for notational vote.  I don't have the vote count on the adoption of the quadrant procedures.  The promotional dues would not have been adopted without Jack's vote.
Shelley  You asked what company Boswell works for.  I've been told that he is a ""non-employee officer"" of Dominion.  The NAESB listing of Board members states he is ""Assistant Secretary, Dominion"".  He is also a partner at McGuire Woods  same firm as Jay Costan.  During meetings (including non-NAESB), I've heard him introduce himself only as Chairman of NAESB's Board of Directors; he doesn't give a company affiliation.  His e-mail address is McGuire Woods.
The voting on quadrant procedures did not synch up with my discussion with Rae.  She stated the votes would be simple majority; super majority votes were taken.  Some people feel NAESB officers were concerned that some segments would not support the procedures, which would bring NAESB to a standstill.  My call to Rae may have piqued their curiosity and raised concerns.  We'll see whether this item remains on Jay Costan's list of errors in the bylaws.
Bill Boswell will soon appoint Board members to the new Parliamentary Committee.  It will consist of two members from each Quadrant (not each Segment) and will address governance issues (e.g., Certificate, Bylaws, Operating Procedures).  It's been suggested that the Pipeline Board members should try to get a seat on that committee.  Recommendations from the Parliamentary Committee should still be voted by the entire Board.  However, their recommendations from a Board committee will have a good chance of being adopted.  My feeling is that Ron Mucci may be interested; I've heard no discussion.

RATES AND REVENUE (RRS)
I've met with Gerry Medeles and Jim Studebaker to discuss RRS.  Initially, I'll attend most meetings to get up to speed and to help where I can with business requirements.  I'm also reviewing as much of the documentation as possible to gather information.

TRADING PARTNER AGREEMENT (TPA)
I've met with Mary Draemer to discuss our pro forma TPA.  It's my understanding that we are using the language of the GISB (NAESB) standard agreement.  We don't know the history of our TPA, but at some point the standard agreement was reformatted and the GISB standard number and copyright info was deleted.
I'll prepare our pro forma TPA, based on the GISB standard.  I'll add certain pieces of information, which we include in our posted pro forma, to the standard agreement.  This will be routed to the attorneys to give them a quick heads-up.  I'll explain that the content has not been changed.
I'll prepare the agreements for UBS and send to them for execution.  The agreements will then be routed to the attorney and then to Shelley for execution.
Shelley  Will you sign for NNG?  If not, who will sign?


NAESB EDM SUBCOMMITTEE
The EDM Subcommittee has begun having frequent meetings.  They have three requests on their plate in addition to their requirement to review the appendices in the EDM book to determine whether updates are needed for the technical characteristics.  The requester wants their changes included in version 1.6.  And, most feel the updates to the appendices are needed in version 1.6.  I'm still working with Terry Lehn on EDM matters.

MOVING NEXT WEEK
My move is scheduled for next Thursday; packed by Wednesday.  I'll do some cleaning out to downsize from office to cubicle.  I'll leave some files in the 47th floor file room until I can go through them.  I want to make sure I have electronic copies before I throw away Board and EC books, standards, etc.  I'll work with Donna Scott on storage."

As you all know, there were several governors events over the past 3 to 4 
days in Washington DC:

Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringer's office.  They 
would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could 
participate in an Energy council that is being formed (actually commissioned 
by the legislature) to study energy issues for the state.  Geringer would 
also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an 
assets based to a market based entity.  

We had contacted Scott Cealy (spelling) with Arizona Governor Hull's office 
last week and  Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and 
had a chance to thank her for her  leadership in opposing price caps. Mr. 
Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to 
see them. I will schedule that meeting (boy that Paul must have been charming 
at dinner!!!)

I sat with Gary Smith, political guy with Gov Kempthorne's office who 
indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on 
Tuesday afternoon.  Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting 
with Cheney, but there was speculation that he may not come.  I have not 
confirmed the outcome of that meeting, but was invited by Mr. Smith to call 
him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow.  I will place that call and see 
what I can find out.  Mr. Racicot was going to get back to us on what he 
found out from Kempthorne-has Linda or Rick heard from him?  I will be 
continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to 
him.

We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March 30 that Governor 
Owens is sponsoring.  Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens 
staff.  As most of you know from previous updates, Owens is strong in his 
support against price caps and market based solutions.

At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance 
from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber.  Lindahow do we want to 
follow up on that request?

Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed 
with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door 
open to future discussions.  Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for 
now.

We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt.  I will continue to 
work on setting that up.  Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to 
meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock 
on that door.  We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some 
commercial reasons.

There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info, 
etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights.

Unfortunately, Gov Owens will be leaving for an overseas trip this week and 
will not be attending the Feb 2 meeting in Portland, so our hope that he 
would be a stong  voice at the meeting is not going to happen.  I think that 
we can get some good work done with the staff, and good support in the long 
term, but we need to look beyond Owens for this meeting.

I got the sense over the weekend that Kempthorne is going to be pretty active 
on this issue, and since he is the chair of the WGA, he will be running the 
meeting.  In talking with FERC Commissioner Hebert at one of the inaugural 
events, he indicated that Kempthorne seemed to be pretty reluctant to take on 
the mantle of market solutions.  Paul has a meeing with Kempthorne's office 
on Friday of this week, so we'll be working on convincing him to be an 
advocate.  

As you know, Jim Souby from WGA did eventually make room on the panel for the 
FEB 2 meeting for us.  A letter of invitation should be on it's way to Steve 
Kean if it has not already been received.  

 I saw Hap Boyd and he says that Enron Wind is participating on Feb. 2 in the 
afternoon session.

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

Below is the email I sent Milton and an attached outline sheet.  Milton 
indicated the he would discuss the idea with Rich Purcell, apparently a main 
partner in the project.  He seemed to be genuinely interested and felt it was 
something Rich would also like.  

The question is, ""Can we facilitate, through the QFs, a contract 
restructuring with PG&E and if so what steps would we propose at this point 
?""(assuming I get interest back from Burney Forest Products.)  I would 
propose that ENA work with the QF to structure the terms of the ""restructed"" 
PPA between the QF and PG&E and that simultaneous with that agreement, ENA 
enter into a long term services deal to supply the market based energy as 
well as provide for an up-fron option premium for the right to ""put"" market 
based power to the QF/utility.

Let me know your thoughts.

Understanding there are many nuances and directions for discussing a contract 
restructuring with the QFs, I am attaching a general outline of a potential 
structure we (Chris Foster and I)  would like to pitch to Wheelabrator.  
Could you look this over and provide your initial comments.  I have thought 
of providing more specific terms in regards to sharing % and potential up 
front payments for the optionality but would like you input.  For example, we 
could apply an option value to the deal.  In Wheelabrator's case, the 
intrinsic reverse toll (ie our ability to provide market based power to the 
IOU using SRAC at 9210 HeatRate) is in the range of $4-5 MM for the Malin gas 
pricing and $9-11 MM if we assume the combined Socal/Malin curve.  If we 
lower the contract heat rate to 8500 the intrinsic value drops about $2 MM.  
The other alternative, which may be the easiest to sell,  is to just agree 
with the IOU/PUC on a lower heat rate and the Malin curve.  

Another value upside, and probably the highest value in the short run, is to 
be able to optimize the QF contract deliverability obligations. (ie.  in a 
very simplified case, if the obligation is only 80 percent, then deliver 80 
%). 

I will give you a call or call me when you have a free moment.

Per our discussions I am writing this note to formally request a regulatory 
opinion regarding the status and possible outcomes with respect to QF PPA 
restructuring in California.  As we discussed, ENA is currently conducting 
due diligence efforts on 2 California QF assets; Mt. Poso and Ace.  Both of 
these assets have SO4 PPAs.  Mt. Poso's is with PG&E and Ace's is with 
Edison.    By the time we acquire these assets, both will be receiving SRAC 
energy prices.  As part of this process, we need to be able to quantify (as 
best we can)  what impact  current PUC discussions will have on the switch 
from SRAC to PX.   Specifically we would like an opinion on the following:

1.) What is the projected timing for switching from SRAC to PX.  This can be 
in the form of a timing probability.  (ie. 50:50 in the next year, etc)

2.) Discussions are ongoing concerning what if any capacity payments are 
imbedded in the PX payments.  Based on what you know on how these discussions 
are moving forward, can you lay out a best case, worst case and most likely 
scenario.   A summary of the possible equation for calculating the new PX 
pricing would be helpful.

3.) You mentioned the possible transition from a transmission losses discount 
to a GMM adjustment.  Any comments you have on these discussions would be 
useful.

Any other comments you may have in regards to the above or the due diligence 
efforts in general would be appreciated.

 If you have any questions please call me at 503-464-3836.

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact your Columbia Gas 
Representative.

GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road.  I say give
the road to the chickens and let them decide.  The government needs to let
go of strangling the chickens so they can get across
the road.

SENATOR LIEBERMAN
I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God In their
own way.  Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no chicken should be
denied the right to cross the road in their own
way.

SECRETARY CHENEY
Chickens are big-time because they have wings. They could fly if they
wanted to.  Chickens don't want to cross the road.  They don't need help
crossing the road.  In fact, I'm not interested in crossing the road
myself.

RALPH NADER
Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil
tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tiremakers to
create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing
there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with
chickens.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay!  Isn't it obvious? Can't you people See the
plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the ""other
side."" That's what ""they"" call it-the ""other side."" Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you
will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like ""the other side."" That chicken should not be free to cross the
road.  It's as plain and simple as that.

DR.  SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The
chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die.  In the rain.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without having
their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
that the chicken crossed the road,and that was good enough for us.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was a historical inevitability.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN JAMES T.  KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens
have to cross before you believe it?

FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook
-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by
""chicken""? Could you define ""chicken"" please?

GEORGE BUSH
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed
the ""black man"" in order to trample him and keep him down.

Dear MAPP Transmission Providers and Customers,

On Wednesday, May 16th at 11:30pm CDT the MAPP OASIS NODE will be taken
off-line for approximately 1 hour for database maintenance.  At the same
time the latest version of OASIS software will be installed , v2.7.0d.

How does this effect MAPP Transmission Providers:

The new version of OASIS software allows for specific redirect service
types.  Two new option fields have been added to the service types, ""Allow
on Redirect"" and ""Account on Reduction"".

These two fields can be changed by selecting ""Transmission Services"" under
Provider Maintenance, and then click on the ID to update the transmission
service.

The ""Allow on Redirect"" option determines whether the service type appears
in the drop down box on the REDIRECT transmission request template.

The ""Account On Reduction"" determines whether REDIRECT request types appear
in the ""Query for Reductions"".

All services types will default to ""No"" for
the two new fields for existing transmission services.

Requirements:
Before the upgrade
1.  All ""Capacity Type"" entries must be unique for each transmission
provider.  Please change your ""Capacity Types"" so that they are unique.

 The ""Capacity Type"" will be changed by the MAPPCOR staff at the time of
upgrade if the unique ""Capacity Type"" for each provider is violated.

After the upgrade
1.  If you do have Redirect transmission service types then select ""Yes"" for
the ""Allow on Redirect"" field.

The MAPP OASIS Test node is available for testing version 2.7.0d.  The test
node can be accessed at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3

How does this effect MAPP Schedule F Customers:

MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers should select ""HNF Secondary"" as the
Service for redirecting a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm reservation as
Non-Firm.

In addition, to redirect a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm
reservation on Firm basis then one of the following services should be
selected ""FCTS Daily"", ""FCTS Weekly"", ""FCTS Monthly"", ""FCTS Seasonal"", ""FCTS
Yearly"", and ""FCTS Monthly 1 Month"" depending on the remaining duration.

Please try to have your business needs concluded prior to this outage.  We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have further
questions at 651.632.8508 or at transcoords@mapp.org.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

651.632.8508

President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle
  guards in Colorado.  Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed
  changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce
  Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could
respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman
Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they
be given six months of retraining.

  Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story,
pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the
teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy.

  ....And so it goes, in this election year.  Don't you just love the
smell of political napalm in the morning?  We are governed by a pack of
fools!






What is a Goron?


1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
    environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his
own
farm: a
    polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income
last
year.

2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is anti-smoking and
anti-tobacco
    when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted
government
    subsidies.

3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in
fact
he
    was placed by family influence in a ""cushy"" correspondent's job
and
the
    only action he saw was that of his Brownie camera!(and his bong)

4. Gorons actually believe that Al Gore is justified in illegally
raising
    political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt
    Law educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al Gore to accept large
sums
    of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had
taken
vows of
    poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
internet""
    would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of
    potentially incriminating e-mail!

7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the
    models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the
book's
author,
    Erich Segal, says that's a bunch of crap.

8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion
    against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars
in
    Occidental Petroleum stock.

9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's
    immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent
on
the
    subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of the
greatest
    Presidents of our history.""

  10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't
    bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
    ineffective that it has led to election of Republicans as BOTH
of
    Tennessee's senators.

  11. Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be
    the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he
served
to the
    poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum
    house that he was renting to them.


  Cautionary Note:Medical researchers acknowledge the Gorons are
generally
   harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately,
   overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to actually
vote
for
   Gore! They should be carefully protected from their ailment,
since
it
may
   be harmful to their well-being, yours, mine, and that of the USA.
   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out

As you are probably aware, if voting results in Florida stand as they
are now, George W. Bush will be our next President.
This will have catastrophic results in our vital  no, indispensable

entertainment industry. Barbra Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin  among many others  have sworn to leave
the country if George W. Bush is elected President.
And this is where YOU can help.  We need volunteers to help pack and
to
load moving vans.  We also need airfare for these irreplaceable national
treasures so they can relocate before they change their minds.
For the cost of a small SUV, you can sponsor one of these celebrities
and their unfortunate relocation.
You will know that your efforts are helping when you receive
postcards,
letters and pictures from your chosen ""refugee"" as they learn to become a
useful citizen in the Third World country of their choosing.
You will help, won't you?  It costs so little but it means so much.

Call 1-800-deport-a-lib.  Operators are standing by.  Major credit
cards

Tomorrow I am meeting with 2 separate consulting groups that represent collectively 15 EMCs in Georgia.  As a result of our calling efforts, it appears as if these 15 are some of the larger EMCs under Oglethorpe.  I think these 2 groups are planning to break apart from OPC and form 2 new agencies (7 in one, 8 in the other).  I plan to get as many details on this as possible during the meetings.

There are 2 opportunities at this point with specific EMCs in each of these groups.  Both are to buy energy on the Georgia ITS.  1) 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, and 2) 20MW, 7x24, 3-5 yrs., beginning 1/1/03, prefer load following at a 73% load factor, but will consider a block purchase.

I'm going to get more details on these separate requests, but wanted your initial interest level.

Thanks,

He spent some time to explain why his market is not tighter.  Basically, the underlying philosophy of their shop is to NOT jump into the new, less liquid markets until they develop further.  They would almost rather see a few markets develop within the region, with high liquidity in each market (as opposed to many markets in the region, with low liquidity in each market).  My response was to be part of developing many market in the region, all with high liquidity.  But, in order to do so and help all the players in the market, we need other participants.

All that being said, his offer is $4 for the Cal'02, into SOCO/on Ga-ITS spread, 5x16.  I'm going to try some of the others (Williams, Dyn, Mirant may be players).

As we discussed, TECO is offering up to 500MW (of a total 960MW) beginning 5/1/04 off the Gannon facility (which is being converted from coal to a gas-fired CC plant, called Bayside).  The plant is in Tampa, FL and the offering is unit-contingent.  

TECO prefers to sell a toll where we bring the gas, but is open to other proposals.  I figure we can bid for any of a few structures: 1) toll where we bring the gas, 2) toll indexed to a gas hub, where TECO is respons. for gas supply, 3) fixed price call.  

I think an at the money call would be the cleanest solution (avoid inefficiency's associated with the heat rate curve which varies by MW amount utilized, gas supply risk, etc.).

What is your preferred structure?  How many MW would you like to show a bid for?  Structuring ran an initial valuation for a 3-year, $35 daily call, 100MW.  Results are below.

A consultant (Energy Consulting Group) in Ga. representing an ""A-rated EMC"" is looking for 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, firm LD energy, ""on"" (not ""into"") the Ga-ITS (that is from any generation source on the ITS, or thru the interface and on the ITS).

From what I know about the Energy Consulting Group, they represent 8 of the larger EMC's in Ga.  We are going to meet with these guys in 2 weeks to see what deals they have available.  It looks like it may be a good opportunity for more short positions on the Ga-ITS.

I will be working with Doug Gilbert-Smith, who is the term trader in Ercot.    Good, solid technical guy.   These guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this,  I agreed to finish the rest of the year in Houston and get this thing up and running.    Ercot is currently not short nor volatile.    Not much fun yet, we'll see how the pool works.
I am working with Smith and Jeff Miller as well.

For all of its sound, fury and ego's the Houston office is actually disorganized and short on morale.    
My transition could have been handled better by a monkey man.      My gut tells me that if I stay with the company,  I will be moving back to Portland early next year if they will have me.

Let me know when you will be in town and I'll set up some golf and margaritas.   No boat anymore,  I'm bumming a ride with my friends.

Later,

For all that have missed the floor meeting,   we have been downgraded to ""junk"" status,  ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price.
A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.     Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least.   
If bankruptcy is filed,  payroll should be covered.
Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.   There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.

Currently,  we are not trading.    We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.    Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.    We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.

More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.     Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.   We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.

We must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.  
 For example,   when we have availability,    or even ""must sell""  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem. 

They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.    


For now,  you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.     Of course,  you can just knock on the door.
In Ercot only,   we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.    No other region has this capability.

This is fantastic.  Exactly what we wanted.  I'll have to change some of the 
wording in the Article 1:3 section to reflect what we are actually basing the

Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and comply with our data retention policies.  These policies are not new.  I have previously sent out e-mails delineating our policy.  This e-mail simply serves as a reminder.  

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Subject: PaloVerde 3


Palo Verde 3 began their refueling outage this past weekend.  During
inspections at Mode 5 (cold shutdown) they discovered a couple cracks
(leaks) in their reactor coolant system.  One was at a temperature detector,
the other was at the pressurizer.  The refueling outage had been expected to
last about a month (restart 10/30/01).  These cracks may delay restart due
to very heightened NRC concern about this kind of cracking.  We will keep
you posted on plans and schedule changes for this outage.

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim"

During the first two weeks of January we would like to hold training sessions for people in our office.  The goal is to provide an overview of each major function in our office to anyone who is interested in learning about what goes on here.  My current thinking is to spend an hour each day, say from 11 AM until noon, in training.  One or more people from each group will be responsible for coming up with an outline/agenda and leading an hour long session on what you do.  If you have received this e-mail, you have been tentatively nominated by me to lead or co-lead one of the training sessions.

Here are the sessions that I propose:

Overview		Tim Belden and/or Chris Calger
Risk			John Postlethwaite
Scheduling		Stacey Runswick, Donald Robinson, Diane Cutsforth
Fundamentals		Tim Heizenrader
Real Time		Bill Williams
Term Trading		Matt Motley
Cash Trading		Sean Crandall
California Market	Jeff Richter
Middle Market		Stewart Rosman and Paul Choi
Services		Chris Foster
Credit			Susan Rance
RTO Development	Alan Comnes
Legal			Christian Yoder
BPA			Steve Hall

Here are some ideas to consider for presentations:
What does your job entail  important timelines and workflow during the day.
Inputs and Outputs to your job  information and people
Who are your internal/external customers?
What is the purpose of your job?
Lingo - what is the vocabulary of your job?

At our meeting I would like to brainstorm potential ideas for the presenations and get some group input on what should be covered and how it should be covered.  Thanks for your help with this."

Well, I figured you could use a joke after dealing with your trader (read 
below).  Hopefully, his positions are doing better today than yesterday so 
your life is a tad more pleasant.  The movie is playing a regular intervals 
(7:30, 8 & 9) so that should give us some flexibility in getting some food 
and then seeing the movie.  I'll talk to you later about the details.

How is getting back to work after living the high life in Austin?  Thanks 
again for the birthday shot and I wanted to see if you were free this weekend 
for dinner - say Saturday night (being the well organized guy that I am - I 
lost your home number otherwise I would have called).  Hopefully, you are 
having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

I hope your day is going well.  I will be in Colorado Wednesday through the 
weekend, so I want to see if you were free to see The Perfect Storm before I 
leave on my mini-vacation.  These 3 and 2 day weeks are really getting too 
much. Just let me know if your schedule is free for a 9:00 show either 
tonight or tomorrow and I'll talk to you later.

I hope your day is going well and your trader and thus you are having a good 
day.  I just realized that I broke the ""rules"" last night.  I should say no 
to a Friday night out when asked out on Wednesday night but I'll let it go 
this time because we are going country and you are breaking out the t-shirt 
and jeans.  When I think about it, that exception applies to every 
situation.  I had fun last night and I think you will be relieved to know 
that I can't get my huge belt buckle on order and shipped in time for 
tomorrow so you are in the clear.

I ran into Ann after lunch today and I remembered that y'all have a common 
friend who wanted to put you two in touch for volleyball.  I played briefly 
with Ann (who is quite the setter) before being removed from the team for 
""attitudinal differences"".  Ann mentioned that she is currently playing once 
a week and may need another female player - I hope that doesn't play on 
Wednesday (steak night) or Thursday (Blancos, Deans etc.) because we know how 
important sitting outside and enjoying a cold beer is. Just chat with each 
other about it.  Otherwise, I hope both of your afternoons are going well.

Well the initial idea doesn't look good (presentation went very well though 
 just not that great an idea) but other ag commodity products are being 
investigated by guess who: Darren and his trusty sidekick Ted.  As for the 
joke below, if you need me to explain it just let me know.  I had fun as well 
as on Saturday and I didn't drink that much last night but I ate so much that 
my belly hurt for hours.  I know life is tough.

For background purposes, UI has a 17.5% ownership interest in the Seabrook 
nuclear facility (total facility is 1142 MW).   The other owners of Seabrook 
are as follows:
  Northeast Utilities 40% (they are driving the sale - it is a condition on 
their Con-Ed merger)
  Great Bay Power  12% (they have announced their intention on selling)
  New England Power 10%
  Other minority owners 20% (8 small minority municipal & IOU owners)

The Seabrook facility has been on the auction block for the past 6-9 months, 
and given the uncertainty of the timing of the sale, Dana & I felt it was 
imprudent to book calender year 2001 until we knew with certainty that the 
plant asset transfer (and associated state, NRC and FERC approvals) would 
occur after 2002.  Remember contractually, EPMI's 200 MW PPA position 
terminates upon final closure of a UI sale of its 17% interest.   With 
respect to Millstone, Pilgrim and Maine Yankee nuclear asset sales, the 
majority owner drives the sale process and minority owners generally almost 
always sell their interest at the same price as the majority owner.   With 
respect to UI's 17.5%  interest in Seabrook, UI has already informed us they 
intend on selling their interest along with the majority owner.

Obviously, the plant has not yet been sold and I feel comfortable (given a 
10-12 month approval process coupled with Seabrook's politically sensitive 
location in New Hampshire) booking the 200 MW position through 2001.

ICAP P&L
Given the huge regulatory uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of ICAP 
in NE,  Dana is uncomfortable taking any of the $55 million to income at this 
time.   Basically, our opinion is that the regulatory decision will either 
result in a default price of $0.50-1.00/kW/Mo (resulting in approx $20-30 
million postive P&L) or a default price of $3-3.50/kW/Mo (loss of $20-30 
million).

The ICAP decision has once again been removed from the FERC agenda for next 
Wednesday's meeting.   This is the 3rd time that has happened in the past 2 
months and indicates a lack of consensus at FERC.   Given this FERC 
indecisiveness and the current situation in California and reliability issues 
in both the Western and Eastern US in general,  I am very concerned that FERC 
does not have the political guts to pull the plug on ICAP (or lower the 
default price to low penalty rate).

Given this regulatory situation, there is a 50/50 chance we lose additional 
money and a 50/50 chance we make additional money.   Said another way, we 
would likely use the entire $55 million in ICAP $'s to completely hedge ICAP 
through the term of UI.

In addiiton, there was a FERC ruling regarding PJM ICAP today that said 
$4.00+/kW/Mo for PJM ICAP was indeed market based and not market 
manipulated.  This coupled with FERC's lack of decision for 3+ months on NE 
ICAP makes us very uncomfortable.   The good news is we are not short PJM 
ICAP.

1)  Monetize $20 million of the 2001 accrual gas position to be utilized for 
the following Schedule C prudency accounts:

$10 million against the JEA (Northern Florida) short position (170,000 MWh's 
on-peak).   We have mid-marketers attempting to buy energy for 01 and 02 in 
FL, however, the market is extremely tight with no competitive offers.   The 
JEA position is covered with FPL non-firm power, therefore, we are exposed to 
on-peak price volatility due to FPL economic curtailment during load 
management periods.
$3 million against the VEPCO market-based call option with a look back audit 
on pricing.  This deal is an absolute pain in the ass because we are forced 
to quote a price to VEPCO that is representative of an actual transaction at 
reasonable prices with a rationale counterparty in the SE market.  They can 
call on the MW daily, weekly, or monthly.   We can lose as much as $2-3 
million/yr on this BS position due to the logistical issues and look back 
audit rights that VEPCO has.
$2 million against the MJMUC (inside Associated Electric Coop) 40 MW 7x24 
short position in a transmission constrained market area with absolutely no 
liquidity.  We have this position marked against the Entergy curves, however, 
physical delivery is a major issue which creates curtailment (and LD$) 
uncertainty.
$5 million against the OPPD 110 MW daily shaped call (with hourly 
flexibility) that is nearly impossible to hedge cleanly.   OPPD is in 
Southern MAPP (Nebraska) and delivery risks are significant.  The total deal 
is in our books at negative $25 million (10/2/00 curves) and we potentially 
have an additional $5 million of exposure due to illiquid nature of MAPP, 
scalar risk, and physical delivery risk.

We have several other customer deals that have hair, however, they are 
generally more manageable from a physical delivery standpoint.   Each of the 
deals above are in illiquid markets with delivery problems and scheduling 
flexibility for the counterparty that is incosistent with the current power 
trading market.   For these generic reasons and the specific issues outlined 
above, I am recommending Schedule C prudency for the amounts indicated 
above.  
From my standpoint, it is prudent and appropriate to use $20 million from gas 
accrual gains to finance these prudency positions.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks."

 RESCO PPA (outages not booked properly) - $8 million
 Congestion & Ancillary Assumptions  - $8-10 million
 Millstone nuclear option ($32/Mwh option) - $5-6 million  (With sale of 
Millstone, this option goes away)

The $32/Mwh Seabrook nuclear plant daily option was not modeled for 01-03 
because the sale of Seabrook (expected to occur earlier this year) is an 
automatic termination of the $32/Mwh option, therefore the value was not 
booked.  Since the sale of Seabrook sale has not occured yet and a minimum of 
10 months is required to get state & local, NRC and FERC approvals for the 
sale of Seabrook, we have a positive value surprise to the tune of $10-12 
million (assuming option is booked through 9/01.

Let me know if you want us to take the value for 4th quarter or wait until 
next year to take the income.    Since we have a pact to not hide anything, I 
wanted to make you aware of this situation.

The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets 
with a ""real supply curve"" and a ""real demand curve"" such that hourly 
clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   With 
respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is 
necessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal model 
for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in 
the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time 
energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing 
is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in 
zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.

Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make 
some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonal 
markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a 
mis-priced commodity with no ""real"" price signal sent to the market.   Out of 
merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion 
is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not 
sent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity market 
where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity 
or transportation on a forward basis.

I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding."

These new marks result in $9 million of incremental value that will hit

Just wanted to give you the a quick update on TIL.  GE is coming out to install Rev4 on Monday (see details below).  

As we discussed earlier today, Rev2 was installed at Caledonia in December, soon after signing PSA with Cinergy.  Rev4 is now out and available.  If we decide to run, we need Rev4.  GE called today to say that the tech is coming to Caledonia on Monday to install Rev4 (or if we delay, it will be two weeks).  Obviously we can't wait two weeks.  As required in the PSA, I called Cinergy (David Tang) to tell him that we are installing Rev4 on Monday and Tuesday and if they want to send someone to the plant to witness the control curve changes, to send someone out on Tuesday (GE's recommendation).  We will also have Ross Newlin from OEC at the plant.

In addition, we confirmed with Michelle April (GE Rep) today that we are still operating under the original TIL issued back in December (which you have a copy of).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Allegheny is no bid on New Albany.  They want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion.  The turbines at New Albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion.

They are interested in pursuing our Longview development in Washington, and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in Entergy.

It looks like I might really have to work at selling New Albany!!!

Quick follow-up on Allegheny, just in case you get a call today.  I have come to learn that Peter Skrgic is now the former President of Allegheny Energy Supply, having just retired in the last month.  He has been replaced by Mike Morrell, who is also the CFO, until someone can be found to replace him.  Morrell should be very familiar with Allegheny's financing plan for these assets. 

To the extent that you want to pass the detailed financing conversation on to me, I am more than happy to have that conversation with Morrell. Also, just so you know, apparently Goldman is going to be the lead banker on the equity offering.  

Let me know if you hear anything or have any questions.

But there was a problem. 
Everything the princess touched would melt. 
No matter what; 
metal, 
wood, 
plastic 
anything she touched would melt. 

Because of this, men were afraid of her. 
Nobody would dare marry her. 

The king despaired. 
What could he do to help his daughter? 

He consulted his wizards and magicians. 
One wizard told the king, 

""If your daughter touches one thing 
that does not melt in her hands, 
she will be cured."" 

The king was overjoyed. 

The next day, 
he held a competition. 
Any man that could bring his daughter an 
object that would not melt would marry her 
and inherit the king's wealth. 

Three young princes took up the challenge. 

The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
The prince went away sadly. 

The second prince brought a huge diamond, 
thinking that diamond is the hardest substance 
in the world and would not melt. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
He too was sent away disappointed. 

The third prince approached. 
He told the princess, 
""Put your hand in my pocket and feel what 
is in there."" 
The princess did as she was told, 
though she turned red. 
She felt something hard. 
She held it in her hand. 
And it did not melt!!! 

The king was overjoyed. 
Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. 
And the third prince married the princess 
and they both lived happily ever after. 


Question: 

What was the object in the prince's pants? 


(Scroll down for the answer) 

? 

?

? 

? 

They were M&M's of course. 
They melt in your mouth, not in your hand.

? The two main points of contention between SB 78XX and AB 82XX appear to be 
the renewables portfolio (SB 78XX's version is thought of as more reasonable) 
and the provisions for a PUC reasonableness review of the long-term 
contracts.  SB 82XX prohibits a reasonableness review, and SoCal is pushing 
for this language to be incorporated into SB 78XX.  This language was also in 
the original MOU between SoCal and the governor."

QF/Generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcy
As reported last week, QF has sitting and waiting to hear what the CAPUC has 
to say, unfortunately it may not be what the QFs want to hear.  The 
utilities' undercollect, which will not be addressed in today's CAPUC 
hearings, could very well provide an invitation for QFs and generators to 
file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal and PG&E.  Recent rate hikes 
proposed by the CAPUC specifically dictate that any revenue generated from 
rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt, leaving the QF 
with little hope of recovery.  QFs were obviously dismayed by the CAPUC's 
draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads, an 
involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely.

CAPUC holds rate increase hearings today
As reported yesterday, Loretta Lynch released the details of the CAPUC's 
draft rate increase order last night.  There is expected to be a 3 cent/kwh 
surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40% rate increase.  A portion of this 
""surcharge"" will be given to the DWR to cover its costs and the order 
concludes that utilities need revenues on a going-forward basis.  Therefore, 
utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are 
expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt (ex. QFs).  
However, the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the QFs on a 
going-forward basis.  The net effect of the order is to allow the utilities 
to operate in case of bankruptcy.

One interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the 
utilities to join  with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount 
overcharged for power by the generators.  The suggestion is that the 
utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds.  Only the 
funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities' past 
debt.  If the utilities choose this course of action, it would be a very 
lengthy process.
  
Davis contends with Lynch on CAPUC rate increases.
Davis has thus far refused to support CAPUC's proposed rate increase stating 
the CAPUC decision making board is an independent body and that he continues 
to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure.  
Sources indicate that he is likely to ask for Lynch's letter of resignation, 
however, there is no indication she will comply.  Senator Burton, who 
supports the CAPUC's plan, reportedly will protect Lynch by not allowing her 
to be impeached (which is the only other way she could be removed by the 
governor)."
kristin.walsh@enron.com|"

? The deal may be enough to save Socal from bankruptcy.  This will depend on 
the payment terms as well as how soon Socal can receive a positive cash flow.
? We are not sure if the State can really do a deal without PG&E or a deal 
for whole grid.  It was thought that a transmission asset deal was not 
possible without PG&E.  This may still be the case; the state may still be 
making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of PG&E's assets.  A generator 
source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy 
court to close the deal on PG&E's lines quickly.  However, bankruptcy courts 
usually do not operate in this manner.  In most cases the court would have to 
hold open proceedings, have competitive bids, etc.
? This purchase would need legislative approval, which is not guaranteed.  
Previously the plan was for the state to purchase SCE's and PG&E's assets at 
a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the 
utilities would be able to buy power for themselves.  Now they would have to 
purchase SCE's lines, but still finance power purchases because of PG&E.  
Additionally, it is possible that Socal swapped the clause allowing then to 
raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book 
price.  If this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain 
legislative approval.
? The purchase would also need FERC approval.  As stated before, if FERC 
approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for California."

? Hertzberg and Keeley had a press conference today at 1:30 PST.  Questions 
included the impact of today's ruling and how it would affect Plan B, 
Hertzberg replied he was not sure.    He also indicated that they support the 
Feinstein bill and if the lawsuit or the rehearing efforts do not work, 
legislation is the last chance for price caps.  Hertzberg also indicated that 
he was getting to the point where CA ""may just say no to prices that are too 
high"" (via buyer cartel).

Another bill is currently being drafted by Assemblyman Keeley and Sen. Battin 
allowing QFs to sell electricity at 8 cents per kilowatt hour (down from 18 
cents) to Socal.  The bill stemmed from a series of negotiations that have 
been taking place with CA government officials.  However, a source close to 
the negotiations confirms that  PG&E was not involved in the meetings. 

Per Friday's update, negotiations continue on a bond issuance plan but sides 
remain divided on amount and if it would include the internal debt of the 
parent companies or just debt due to external creditors."

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California 
Assembly.  The bill would pass with a simple majority as a non-urgency bill, 
meaning the bill would not take effect for 90 days.  The state would be 
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute 
financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) 
Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem now will be the 
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission 
line purchase or other assistance."

Municipal Power is Politically Attractive
There is growing pressure across California for cities to consider forming 
their own municipal power companies. Community leaders across the state are 
enviously eyeing the success of Sacramento's SMUD utility and the Los Angeles 
Municipal Power Utility, where rate hikes and service disruptions have been 
far less pronounced than the rest of the state. Several leaders in San 
Francisco are considering setting up their own power company, and another two 
dozen cities are also contemplating action. Municipal power companies are not 
subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission, and 
could therefore sidestep the current proposed structure of rate hikes. 

Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will 
be extremely difficult, as it runs against some of the most entrenched and 
long-standing privileges in California politics. Under California law, it is 
very difficult to stop many cities from doing what they feel is in their best 
interest. Most older and larger cities are ""charter cities"" rather than 
""general law cities"" subject to the California Municipal code. Under the 
California Constitution, charter cities can pretty much do anything or 
provide any service short of printing money and raising an army.  The League 
of California cities - a weighty organization representing every one of 
California's cities - is already swinging into action to support direct 
access. Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councilors and have some 
sympathy with local independence. And the resistance within the Assembly is 
already building against Hertzberg's attempts to stop even large companies 
getting direct access. 

Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state 
legislature on the issue. But if municipalities do not opt out, they may have 
to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more 
for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power 
company. Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major 
employers. Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies 
stand to gain or lose a fortune on this matter, and this could affect 
campaign contributions. 

State Power Plans at Risk
If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies, it could 
undermine at least three key elements of the State of California's power 
plans: 
? First, the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other 
large users. But municipal power would unpick this structure, allow large 
regions of California to ignore the PUC, leaving the rate structure to be 
determined city by city. Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure 
from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes. 
Others might cave into irate voters.
? Second, the plans laid out by Governor Davis' and State Treasurer 
Angelides' for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly 
damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it.  It is possible 
that long-term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if 
municipalities opt out of higher long-term rates by buying on the open 
market.  It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have 
to sell at a loss.
? Third, revenues to back the proposed power bond could be imperiled, if 
municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to 
repay the bond. And if the momentum for direct access develops among the 
cities and municipalities across the state, it could make it much more 
difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright 
at potential threats to the viability of repayments. 
The issue is at an early stage  the PUC had a general workshop on the 
matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday.  State legislative leaders 
are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal 
secession, or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully 
away. But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path 
could prove to be difficult. "

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer.

ENA Gas Assets Group Outing

You have between now and June 6th to practice and get ready.  It's time to 
get in touch with you inner bowler.  That's right, we are going bowling!!!!  
Tuesday, June 6th all of Gas Assets, everyone under Brenda's direction, will 
be going Bowling.  We will depart the Enron building between 2:45 and 3:15 on 
buses (no not the yellow kind) and we head for Dynamic Lanes, where everyone 
will be placed on a team of 4, bowl three games, compete and cheat (just 
joking) for fabulous prizes and then return to the Enron building around 6:00 
pm, just in time to catch buses and go home.

FAQ
Is it mandatory that I go?

No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out 
of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and 
you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.


 If I don't go bowling can I leave work / stop working at 2:45. ?

No.

If I do go does that mean I do not have to return to work to complete 
required daily tasks such as P&L?

No."

Attached are the prayer requests for Wednesday, November 15.  Also,
following is a follow-up to a question about The Lord's Prayer and what
Jesus meant when He said ""Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil"".  Mary Rios, thank you for asking.  It has been a rewarding study as I
have searched the Word, Strong's and other resources and it is beautiful.
First, here is an insert from what Eloise, our dear sister that comes to the
Bible Study on Wednesday's with Pat McFarland has to offer.  I asked her to
write it down for us as a remind:

Carol,

Thank you so much for your prayers.  I did get your message and here is
the verse of the Lord's Prayer, we tallked about  in class.  The
Spanish  version is ""No, los dejes caer ententacion"", interpreted as
""No, Let us not fall into temptation.""  Or it can be ""No, lead us not
into temptation.""  Either one is asking in prayer for our Lord Savior to
help in the choices we are faced with daily and many times there are
temptations.

Carol, the word Lead, I believe is problably what has confused the
lady in class and maybe the word Let might also, but we need to look at
the total verse.  I honestly believe the articulation in much of the
material we process sometimes needs to be looked at closely for precise
meaning.  I believe that in praying and asking for our Lord Jesus to
discern what is really meant, this is my answer.
-
Here is what I feel explains it as well:

When Jesus commanded us to pray ""Lead us not into temptation"" He was
instructing believers to pray that forces beyond their own control would not
lead them into trials (see Matt 24:20, Revelation 3:10).  ;He is also
commanding believers to watch and pray against entering into temptation
through their own carelessness or disobedience (Matt 26:41, Luke 21:34; Luke
22:40, 46).

Jesus had warned Peter;  ""Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have
you, that he may sift you as wheat"" (Luke 22:31).  Knowing Satan's plans,
Jesus cautioned Peter to watch and pray lest he enter into temptation.  This
indicates that if Pete would have listened to Jesus, he would have remained
strong.

Jesus also knows our potential weaknesses.  He remembers we are dust (Ps
103:14).  He knows our human spirits may be willing, but our flesh is weak.
He realizes that we can give in to temptation as a result of our own
carelessness and disobedience, and Jesus knows of forces can circumstances
beyond our control that can come to try us.  Therefore, He lovingly commands
us to pray ""Lead us not into temptation"".

Jesus will not lead us there.  When we pray for His leadership, He leads us
away from it.  According to Strong's it is asking Him to make us strong and
be our guide.

There is more to it than only that which we can get into, and should most
definitely, later.

Have a safe, blessed Holiday and know I will be praying for all of you.  See
you next on Wednesday, November 29th when Juan Barba's wonderful Godly
mother will minister to us from a mother's heart.

God Bless you...Carol

They have been given authority by the PUC to begin taking steps to sell from the remaining two (Alsio and La Goleta), but the PUC left some issues (principally around ratemaking) open, and have not given them the authority to actually begin selling the gas.  SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  However, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at book valueunclear where the Commission will come out on that.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Some time back I distributed the final term sheet summarizing the settlement 
that a large number of interests reached with SoCalGas to unbundle SoCalGas' 
Transportation, Storage and Balancing assets and services.   Recently, many 
have asked questions about the status and substance of the settlement.  The 
Term Sheet summarizing the settlement is attached.

The California Commission has held hearings on the settlement and parties are 
now filing briefs.  The ALJ's proposed decision should be out in the next 
45-60 days or so and the Commission should be in a position to approve or 
reject the proposal in mid- to late fall.

Over thirty parties signed the settlement.  They represent everyone from 
small consumers, to pipelines, to marketers, to utilities.  Only 2-3 parties 
actively opposed it.  Unfortunately, California has a new governor, and his 
two recent appointments to the Commission have thus far been pretty 
unfriendly when it comes to competition.  Nonetheless, there's a significant 
effort underway on the part of a large number of parties to win Commission 
approval.  I'll keep you posted.

If you have any questions about either substance or status, don't hesitate to 
email or call at 415.782.7822.  Please forward along to others who might be 
interested.

Best,

But knowing PG&E and how these things work, it ain't ever over till its 
over.  PG&E may not have spelled it out in the testimony, but as you 
recognize, Jeff, it doesn't mean that someone else won't spell it out clearly 
on PG&E's behalf.  I'll be comfortable when the Commission adopts TW's 
proposal and makes the Wheeler situation fit into that framework, rather than 
have PG&E's ""generic"" framework win the day and then try to protect TW within 
that framework.  

We'll need to stay on top of it and stay active.

I just received this from my friend. I don't remember who I sent the prayer
request to for the couple having a baby. I thank you for your prayers
though. It is amazing how God will be glorified through this situation.
Kristy


Hey guys -

Thanks for  all the prayers for Toby and Cindy.  Cindy had the baby on
Tuesday and as of last night, Thursday, he was doing well.  He does have
anencephaly.  The back part of his skull is not formed and they don't
know how long he will live.  They are still in the hospital and will probably
remain there.  Toby and Cindy are doing really well and the baby has
touched many lives in the few days he has been here.  His name is Ian 
Christian.
He weighed 5 lbs. 15 ounces and I'm not sure of the length.  I guess nurses
have been coming in wanting to see him and many have cried.  Ian's
pediatrician, which she is from India, asked Toby and Cindy about their
faith because they are doing so well.

My husband and I were talking about this last night and I can't even
imagine going through this; but what about those people that don't know 
Christ as their Personal Savior.  How would they ever get through it?

I'll keep you all up to date.  Toby and Cindy told Ian that he could go
be with Jesus, but as of last night he's still here.  God must still have
some more lives for him to touch before he goes Home.

Keep them in your prayers and thanks for all the prayers, I know they
feel them.

Love to you all - Molly

 ?A man's daughter  had asked the local minister to come and pray 
  with her father.  When the minister arrived, he found the man lying 
  in bed with his head propped up on two pillows.  An empty chair 
  sat beside his bed.  The minister assumed that the old fellow had 
  been informed of his visit. ""I ?guess you were expecting me,""  he said. 
 ? 
 ?""No, who are you?""  said the father. 
 ? 
 ?The minister told him his name and then remarked, ""I see the empty 
  chair; I figured you knew I was going to show up."" 
 ? 
 ?""Oh yeah, the chair,""  said the bedridden man. ""Would you mind closing 
  the door?""  Puzzled, the minister ?shut the door. ""I have never told anyone 
  this, not even my daughter,"" said the man. ""But all of  my life I have 
 ?never ?known how to pray.   At church I used  to hear the pastor 
 ?talk about prayer, but it went right over my  head.  I abandoned 
 ?any attempt at prayer,"" the old man continued, ""until one day about 
 ?four years ago my best friend said to me, 'Johnny, prayer is just 
 ?a simple matter of having a  conversation with Jesus.  Here is what 
 ?I suggest.  ""Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of 
 ?you, and in faith see Jesus on the chair.   It's not spooky because he 
 ?promised, ""I'll  be with you always."" Then just speak to him in the 
 ?same way  you're doing with me right now.' ""So, I tried it and I've liked it
 ?so much that I do it a couple of hours every day.  I'm careful though. 
 ?If my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair, she'd either 
 ?have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm."" 
 ? 
 ?The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the 
  old man to continue on the  journey.  ?Then he prayed with him, 
  anointed him with oil, and  returned to the church. Two nights later 
  the daughter called to  tell the minister  that her daddy had died 
  that afternoon. 

  ""Did  he die in peace?"" he asked. 
 
 ?""Yes, when I  left the house about two o' clock, he called me over to 
  his  bedside, told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek.   
  When I  got back from the store an hour later, I found him dead. 
  ""But there was something strange about his death. Apparently, 
  just  before Daddy died, he leaned over and rested his head on 
  the chair beside the bed. What do you make of ?that?"" 
  ? 
 ?The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said,  ""I wish we could all go 
like that."" 
 ? 
 ?Just ?send this to  four people and do not break this, please. Prayer is 
  one of the  best free gifts we receive. There is no cost but a lot of  
rewards.

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to ""make pancakes,"" for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

So the man yelled ""God speak to me"" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, ""God let me see you."" And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, ""God show me a miracle"" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, ""Touch me God, and let me know you are
here"" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are.

Take 60 seconds & give this a shot! Let's just see if Satan stops this one.

All you do is -

1) Simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this, (Father God, 
bless this person in whatever it is that You know he or she may be needing 
this day!)

2)Then send it on to five other people.

Within hours five people have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of 
people to pray to God for other people. Then sit back and watch the power of 
God work in your life for doing the thing that you know He loves.

Please send it back to me, so that I can also pray for you!!!"

Subject: Your Friend

Darlene,
I have a friend in my Sunday School class who is the Josten's distributor 
here in Dallas. This is the company that makes class rings. He will sell me a 
class ring at cost! (How 'bout that?) So, if you will get the info from your 
friend about her daughter (ring size, school, name, etc) I will get her a 
ring. I don't know that I can afford gold, but I can silver, if that is ok. 
If we want gold, we could maybe pool some money. The cost of a gold ring is 
$175 vs $75 for silver. Anyway, just let me know as soon as you can so that I 
can get it ordered. I'm not sure on the delivery time, but we do need to get 
moving on it so that she can enjoy it before the school year is over.
 
Blessings!
Kent

You see, I am one of those very fortunate people who, until a few years ago, 
had perfect 20/20 vision.
As we who are over 40 very well know, you start to lose your ""good eyes"" and 
must resort to eye glasses or contacts.  Well, after several years of 
fighting with the glasses, losing them, sitting on them, etc., etc., I opted 
last year for a contact lense (i.e. one  Mono Vision).  It has been trying 
as you have to get used to focusing with one eye for reading and the other 
for distance.  

I had a conversation with my eye doctor yesterday, wanting a miracle cure, 
you know, 20/20 vision in the form of, I don't know!!, a simple pair of 
contacts?  Or, Was I a candidate for surgery?  He said that we (former 
20/20's) were the worst when it came to contacts as we had the most difficult 
time accepting our perfect vision loss.  

Immediately, I was humbled....  ""Okay, okay, I hear you, I understand.""  
At least I CAN see with corrective lenses, so what if it is not perfect.  

As you read below, I really am much more blessed than the many, many, many 
people of the world...

I will never complain again (well... not for a few days anyway).  

Bless and be Blessed!!!

Speaking from experience, I think that it's critical for Tanya and Anjam to 
visit MG in New York
and establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk 
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions

 will be very helpful.

First, I think it's dangerous for me to walk into any of the PNW Senator or 
Congressman's offices and talk about our interests in legislation on the 
retail side.  Their key focus will be BPA and you (not me) are clearly the 
expert on those issues.  I am planning on handling (or others in the Western 
States Group will handle) non-PNW states, but I think it makes more sense 
for  you to meet with the PNW folks (either with me or without me) because of 
their focus on BPA issues. 

Second, since you are already working so closely with Congressional staffers, 
it may not be necessary to visit with the Senators and Congressmen when 
they're home.  

The only reason to do so, is that you do get better access to the members 
themselves when they're home.   In this regard, you may want to talk with 
Cynthia and Craig Gannett about a visit with Slade Gorton, Gordon Smith, and 
Ron Wyden.  

I've met Smith (who probably won't remember me) and had dinner with Wyden at 
former law partner's house (so he may remember me)let me know what you 
think.   I'd be happy to join you and talk about state issues, but it only 
makes sense in my mind if you are their to talk about BPA stuff."
paul.kaufman@enron.com|"




It appears from talking with both of you that we have some confusion on how 
we will contract for legal services to support or legislative efforts.  
Hopefully this e-mail will clarify the process so there is no confusion in 
the future and so that Mike can feel comfortable he is completing work that 
is authorized and for which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears that Goodin, MacBride has billings as of May 11 for 
approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall profits, the ""Global 
Settlement,"" Power Plant Siting.  We will cover these amounts because of the 
apparent confusion with our budgeting and approval process.  The amounts 
already incurred should be included in the RCRs discussed below.  

2.  As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May 
was conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know 
we terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs 
were filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis; the 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, a proposed budget is not RCR approval.  

3.  In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arisesi.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, then I should be 
contacted before completing any work.  If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes 
should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, then Rick Shapiro should be 
contacted.   In this regard, I authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in 
the Direct Access coalition meetings taking place today and tomorrow.  I also 
authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  To the maximum extent possible, I expect that Mike will 
include Leslie Lawner in future Direct Access meetings, legislative drafting 
efforts, etc.  

4.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, I should be contacted before undertaking an assignment.  
If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, 
then Rick Shapiro should be contacted.  I can be reached through my office 
line503.464.7945, pager888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  I wear 
the pager at all times and respond immediately to messages left on the 
pager.  

5.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride; it simply means that before that work begins 
Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and ""Plan B,"" to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  I 
recognize that Sacramento is a difficult environment and that there is 
substantial pressure on both of you.  However, we are under an obligation to 
use our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process is designed to meet that responsiblity.  "

Thanks for sending this message.  Checked with Baird and his initial view is 
that we should say something in the form of an additional release if Monday 
comes and we can't complete our Q.  He will discuss with Rex and give me 
final input as soon as possible.  I know this isn't a desirable result, but 
Bob thinks we'd be worse off if we said nothing-and then waited for people 
to call us.  We wouldn't need to say much, just something to the effect that 
we are continuing to work through the open integration issues, etc.  The 
specific wording would have to be worked out internally. I believe Susan and 
Dana also believe that we should say something if we can't complete the Q on 
Monday.  I'm in Ireland with my son, but I will follow up on this with IR and 
others and advise. Thanks.  SWD

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning pointwe could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

I wanted to keep you up-to-date on the redevelopment of forward curves for the suite of 7 plastics (ethylene contract, ethylene spot, propylene contract, propylene spot, polypropylene, HDPE, LLDPE).  As you may recall, we talked about fitting all of the components into a VAR model and solving the system of simultaneous equations.  Unfortunately, with a limited dataset (say 5 years or so), our degrees of freedom in such a model are dramatically reduced.  Alternatively, Mauricio and I have decided to construct individual models for each of the plastics commodities while utilizing results from the initial VAR analysis as a guide.  

Based on the petrochemicals flowsheet, both propylene and ethylene are fashioned directly from raw materials such as crude oil, coal, and natural gas.  In turn, polypropylene may be made from propylene while HDPE and LLDPE use ethylene as a raw material.  Given this logical flow, we restricted our model specifications in the following manner (all price variables tested for stationarityfirst difference used in all cases):

1) Construct models for ethylene contract and ethylene spot based on AR terms, WTI, and natural gas.  Determine the ""best"" model between ethylene contract and ethylene spot as a function of these variables (based on R2).

2) Supplement the model above with the smaller R2 value with the contemporaneous and lagged values of the dependent variable from the other model (e.g., construct ethylene contract as a function and WTI and natural gasconstruct ethylene spot as a basis to ethylene contract).

3) Repeat the process for propylene refinery grade and propylene chemical grade.  

4) For polypropylene, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of propyleneRG, propyleneCG, WTI, and natural gas.

5) For HDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, WTI, and natural gas.

6) For LLDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, HDPE, WTI, and natural gas.

Note that we are aware of the ""cascading error"" problem as we move from model to model.  Alternatively, we can construct each model based only on WTI and natural gas (see first-cut of polypropylene model).  We do have monthly fundamental supply and demand information for 3 of the plastics (polypropylene, HDPE, and LLDPE) and will incorporate this data as well.  Alan Engberg has forwarded the latest 12 month forward curves from the current model that is being used.  He has also offered his own projections for these commodities over the next 12 months.  We'll compare the revised model projections with both the old model projections and Alan's numbers and then make a decision on next steps.

Jo's number in Omaha is 402-398-7707.  Per our discussions, I did meet with Vernon Mercaldo and Sean Bolks yesterday to discuss the options needs of Northern Natural Gas (at the request of Jo).  They are interested in developing about 6 different models w/ varying degrees of complexity.  I am currently in the process of expeditiously figuring out C++ and the associated linkage to Excel for final model development.  I did speak with Krishna this morning w/regard to their needs and he seems more than willing to help in this area.

The proposal does emphasize the importance of stationary time series and the cointegration approach using an error correction model (ECM) or vector error correction model (see Bessler's CV publications).  These remarks offer reassurance that we have probably been taking the right approach in our other modeling work (e.g., diesel fuel-heating oil cointegration, JCC-Brent crude cointegration, etc.).  We haven't yet implemented VAR in our price modeling work, but will likely use this approach for the suite of plastics (e.g., polypropylene, propylene, ethylene, HDPE, etc.) as well as for price indexes within the tech sector (e.g., semiconductor equity index, pc equity index, etc.)

For the record, we have been working with EIM fundamentals on the development of a newsprint price curve.  Cointegration was considered for newsprint price, lumber prompt month futures, and pulp prompt month futures; however, the correlation analyses suggested that the difference relationships were very weak.  We instead focused on developing price as a function of newsprint supply and demand terms (e.g., North American and Canadian production, producer inventory, US newsprint demand, total newspaper dailies inventory, consumer days of supply, etc.).

In short, I don't have a problem with the TAMU approach or the scope of work.  If EIM fundamentals does carry through with this relationship, it might be beneficial to offer some research input along the way, especially since we are somewhat familiar with the technical approach and the needs of the Enron business units.

I had a chance to speak today with a representative from Estima, the maker of RATS.  Evidently, our current license is as follows:

		Version:  RATS 4.0 (original license cost of $ 1,200.00)
		Max. No. of Users: 4

The following options outline the costs of upgrading the software:

Option 1

Version:  RATS 5.0
Users: Site license for Houston/unlimited

	RATS 5.0	$ 5,100.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00    	(cointegration module)
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00    	(RATS implementation of Census Bureau's seasonal adjustmentaids in 			$ 7,500.00       	adjusting quarterly and monthly data as well as options for identifying 					trading days and holidays in time series) 

Option 2

Version:  RATS 5.0
Users: 100

	RATS 5.0	$ 4,500.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00
			$ 6,900.00

Option 3

Version: RATS 5.0
Users: 50

	RATS 5.0	$ 3,600.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00
			$ 6,000.00

Option 4

Version RATS 5.0
Users: 25

	RATS 5.0	$ 2,500.00
	CATS module	$ 1,100.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,100.00
			$ 4,700.00

Note that we currently have a number of users of RATS both within Research and throughout EGM (Equities, Freight, Fundamentals, Crude Products).  I would recommend, at a minimum, that we upgrade our license to 50 users with base RATS 5.0.  Cointegration can obviously be performed without the automated CATS moduleI am not too certain of the utility of the X-11 module.

This was not a replacement for any meeting.  I had intented this to be a working/decision making/resolution meeting
for energy ops.

I have a group of people working on various issues that are interdependent.  This was a chance for
them to hear progress from the different areas.  We included IT because most of our issues are dependent
on them completing certain items before we can move ahead.

thanks

Resolved:

	Confirmations will be done out of AEP's systems for long term deals, intramonth transactions
	will be confirmed using DECAF 2.  DECAF 1 will not be used.

	Global Facilities will not need to copied to a new pipeline code.

	The HPL DUN's number will remain the same.

	Deal entry will be manual for AEP risk system and getting old deals back into Sitara.
	The need to build a cross-reference table is the main driver.

New items

	A hands-on  training program is unlikely due to time  and space constrains.
	AEP/Enron evaluating options.

	New Risk Portfolios need to created in Sitara.  List provided to AEP.
	Enron giving explanations of portfolios for usefulness to AEP.

	Manual entries to G/L and reports needed to book all items.


All items on the Energy ops issues list were discussed.  AEP to fill in point person
for there side. 

Agreement reached to use this format and add items as needed.

I will issue a revised transitions issues list tomorrow afternoon, after my energy ops
meeting.

bob.hall@enron.com|"

Please review and send any changes so I can update.

I will update again Thursday and will include a column for status.

We are in the process of drafting procedures which will have to become a formal protocol for AEP.

These are:

Request for New/maintenance of counterparties.  Once Web page is developed, procedures will
be completed.

Request for new portfolios (books) after close.  Drafting procedures.

Request for new employee security.

Request to change curve mapping in ERMS/CPS.  Drafting procedures.

Also, it appears the IT service agreement may have to be amended to cover the 
Web pages used to push operational data to customers (If AEP wants to continue
the service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.

Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit has request we suspend trading when
AEP wants to continue trading.

We have had discussions with AEP about all of these issues and procedures.

bob.hall@enron.com|"

We will have to come up with a way to confirm just certain deals and not all deals.

I will add to the meeting for next week.

thanks

bob"
bob.hall@enron.com|"


Attached below is the list and where we stand on reconcilations.  About 50% are reconciled, meaning that
the counterparty agrees with our number.

Most we are waiting on information from the counterparty.

The big items are the imbalances with Duke Energy, Gulf Energy, and Tejas.

Rita and I have people working with these counterparties to get good information.

Gentlemen 

A busy day in India that is likely to generate substantial press.

MSEB sent us 2 letters stating that there will be no Phase II performance 
testing, MSEB will not pay any further amounts under the PPA and MSEB will 
draw no further power from Dabhol.  MSEB requested that DPC stop providing 
availability declarations.  These letters turn the vague ""recission"" letter 
that we received last week into a more concrete repudiation by MSEB.

On Friday, MSEB filed a 120 page petition with the Maharashtra Energy 
Regulatory Commission seeking relief on a number of issues.  MSEB's position 
seems to be that because they are no longer bound by the PPA, that the MERC 
is the appropriate regulatory body to regulate the MSEB/DPC relationship 
(e.g., determine the price for power and the amount owed by DPC on the 
misdeclaration claim).  The MERC ruled today that it likely has jurisdiction 
in this matter and granted some interim relief to MSEB (including stopping 
any arbitration proceedings by DPC against MSEB).  We are preparing a 
petition tor the Bombay High Court to overturn the MERC's actions.

The Government of India continues to state publicly that it will not buy 
power from Dabhol.  Accordingly, we have existing counterparties (MSEB and 
GOM) that do not want Dabhol's power and are not creditworthy and no 
reasonable hope at present to find other viable counterparties.

Bruce"
rob.walls@enron.com|"

Gentlemen -

On Saturday, we received the consent required from the lenders to serve 
Preliminary Termination Notices (PTNs) on MSEB under the PPA.  The consent 
allows us to serve PTNs for basically every bad act committed by our Indian 
counterparts to date.  We will need further lender approval to serve PTNs for 
future bad acts.

On Saturday, we served PTNs on MSEB for (a) failure to pay certain amounts 
under the PPA and (b) repudiation by MSEB of the PPA.  There are a few more 
PTNs that will be served on MSEB in early June  the underlying defaults for 
these PTNs required a 60 day notice period before service of a PTN and these 
notices were served in early April.

Paul Kraske, General Counsel of Dabhol Power Company, told me that he 
receives 4 Indian newspapers (including national newspapers) at his 
apartment.  On Sunday, our service of the PTNs was the lead story in all 4 
newspapers.

Bruce"
rob.walls@enron.com|"

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The lender meetings in Singapore this week have been challenging.  The Indian 
banks are trying to induce the foreign banks to fund into a project with a 
repudiated PPA.  It is becoming more apparent to us that the Indian banks are 
being heavily influenced by the Government of India and not acting as 
commercial institutions.  Our business people do not believe that all or most 
foreign banks will continue funding at this point.  It is likely that the 
Indian banks could act on their own to cure the construction contract 
payments which give rise to termination this month (about $34 million).  
Within a few months, however, the Indian bank facility would be fully funded.

Today, we filed our writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging MERC's 
jurisdiction.  While we have a hearing date scheduled on Monday, there is 
some doubt whether or not we will get a hearing on that date.

Deal info: IP is the Utility relative to our proposed NICOR transaction
Facility: Nicor Storage Facility at Troy Grove, Ill

Note: IP is owned by Dynegy, however, I understand that IP is bound by ""affiliate rules"" with regards to Dynegy. How comfortable are you with this? Do you think we need additional language in the CA to protect us?


With regards to the Devon CA the following are the Devon comments;
 

You should add at the beginning of paragraph 3, the following:  ""Each party represents that in providing Confidential Information to the other, it has the right and authority to do so.""
Whenever we look at a CA, we should endeavor to limit it in time and coverage.  You say that the agreement concerns purchase of electricity in the Carthage area, but in the opening paragraph, the CA states that it is related to ""a proposed sale and/or purchase of natural gas or fuel.""
You should get this clarified to say something more definitive.  For example, more definitive language would be something like ""...in connection with a proposed sale and/or purchase of electricity in the Carthage Field area for purpose of providing power to compression facilities.""
Other than that, the CA looks good.  Thanks.

It appears that in our efforts to collect information from the pipelines we are duplicating some efforts. 

Rita Wynne's team is also actively collecting and reviewing pipeline invoice information. She has suggested that we coordinate with her team to more efficiently gather the information and keep the pipelines from getting bombarded with requests. The pipelines have been assigned to specific people in her group.

We should continue to contact the pipelines and request a list of their active agreements, inform them of our intentions to work with them and let them know that someone in our group is in the process of confirming outstanding invoice information with them as well  and would appreciate their cooperation. We should then work directly with our internal contact to determine the status of the invoice claims.

Rita will need a prioritized list of the pipelines. We can get together as a group and decide on the best way to prioritize the list.  I will provide her with the same list that PW will get - ""Pipeline Status Summary"" so that she can get a feel on were we stand with each pipeline. She will also have access to the detailed contract list were we are tracking the dollar amounts for each agreement.

Invoice indicates that the PAL Contract number is PAL1001 for both.
Deal 1424 is the one that shows a negative (96,000) balance and Deal 1222 indicates a 266,241 balance.

Kelli's spreadsheet indicates that 8588 was sold a day Jan 1-Jan 8, 2002. This sell needs to be verified as well as the price it was sold for. If this sell is correct, the new balance would be 197,537?

Like I mentioned before, Kelli indicates that a letter was received that indicates that the 96,000 was withheld for PAL and 101,437 was withheld until payment received. I do not have a copy of the letter, but it would be helpful to know who in legal is working on this.

Since the volume is so small and does match the amount listed in TXOK it is highly possible that this an error.

Important Note:  Due to the lawsuit we should not be deleting any emails.  
When our lotus notes are transferred to outlook we will still 
                                             have access to read all of our 
old notes.  Eventually notes will go away, but because of the lawsuit nothing 
can be deleted
               until a later date.  Also, I know everyone has concerns about 
the size restriction, and purge process in outlook.  (Please remain
               calm; breath in through the nose, out through the mouth.)  
Until the lawsuit is cleared up the SF office will not be bound by Enron's
               Outlook rules.  However, there will come a day when we will 
have to adhere to the policies.  

Extra Cool Note: In outlook you can save an entire email, headings & 
attachments too, as a word document.  It is very, very exciting.  This will 
be the 
                                              feature that helps us keep our 
in-boxes, and outlook folders fairly empty.  I will show everyone how easy it 
is once we have been
                                              completely converted. 

 
I think everyone is going to like outlook.  Please give it a chance.  I 
promise Wilma and I will address all of your concerns.

Enron has decided to outsource our accounts payable department and also 
implement a whole new system for paying invoices.
What this means to all of us is you may receive email(s) from iBuyit 
Payables.  These are very important emails!  These are invoices
that need to be paid.  Any ENA people receiving invoices should automatically 
assume they go to me.  As for Sue's group I think
any invoices you receive will need to go to Joseph.  If you are unsure please 
let he or I know and we can figure out which one of us should
get the invoice.

Here is the irritating part: You can not just forward the iBuyit Payables 
email to me/him.  You must click onto the first link in the email (see 
example below).
Then log on to the iBuyit Payables system using your P00# and log-on password 
(these are the same P00# and password you use to access
eHRonline).  At this point you will be at your iBuyit Payables in-box.  I 
pasted a copy of my in-box below as an example.  There are boxes to check
if you want to forward the invoice.  If you check them all then click on 
'Quick Forward' a forward box will appear.  Type in mine, or Joseph's (if 
it's his
invoice) last name in the 'last name' box, then click search.  From there you 
can click 'Forward'.  I will not only ensure the invoice is paid, but also 
give the vendor the correct information for future invoices.

Please bare with me during this time.  This whole process isn't going to be 
very much fun for any of us.  However, I have made it my priority to have 
this new invoice situation organized as quickly as possible.  If anyone has 
any questions please let me know.  On one last note:  All paper invoices 
should still be given directly to me then I can send them to A/P for scanning.

Thanks,
April Hrach

This is in response to our meeting of April-10-2001 in Midland with Agave.

Assuming units #761 and #762 are now assigned to LEC-10"" service, the below schematic is showing the capacity of the three remaining units #822, #842 and #845 at Atoka-3.

At suction pressure of 225 psig and discharge pressure of 560 psig the capacity is 36 mmcf/d.  






The 36 mmcf/d is not a fixed capacity, if discharge pressure increases the capacity decreases. Basically it depends on the volume activities between Atoka-3 and Atoka-1 such as BP, Rio Pecos and GPM.
Please pass this on to Agave.

If you have any questions please call.

Michelle

In order to make this interconnect bi-directional the following work need to be performed: 
( capacity 35- 60 mmcf/d at 800-850 # pressure)

1):  Blowdown gas in 5.335 miles of 12"" ( gas-loss) at 1000# pressure

2):	Remove a flapper in the check-valve or turn around the existing check-valve


The  cost for this is approximately $8,000 to $10,000.

Still waiting for Earl Chanley from Roswell to send me some facility information regarding the Pecos interconnect.

mansoor.abdmoulaie@enron.com|"

Based on our meetings, I thought if TW pursues this we might get some of this gas supply to our system and I have made the following assumptions :

n	BP has 50 mmcf/d at 750 psig
n	Agave   75 mmcf/d at 750 psig     
n	NGPL   42 mmcf/d at 750 psig

   Total             167 mmcf/d.



To tie 167 mmcf/d to TW-36"" at 950 psig pressure would require 4,000 hp recip units.
The estimated ""A"" release cost (+-30%) is approximately $6,000,000.

If you have any questions/ comments please call.

mansoor.abdmoulaie@enron.com|"

The existing capacity of this system is 38 mmcf/d.
Now that we know where the exactl location of the tie-in is and based on  your input I have created two flow modeling options for this project::
 
Option-1:
Assuming 30 mmcf/d from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can do another 12 mmcf/d from Conoco at 576 psig pressure for a total of     42 mmcf/d. If the pressure at Lanam Ranch reduces, it will change the capacity to a lower figure. 
  			

  Option-2:
  Assuming 0 (zero) from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can handle 62 mmcf/d from Conoco at 696 psig pressure.

						


If the pressure at Conoco reduces, it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity.
If you have any comments please e-mail me as soon as you can so we can finalize the capacity of this system.

The following is a level ""A"" cost estimate to make TW/ Lonestar existing interconnects bi-directional.


TW/ Lonestar at Ward County ( 50 to 60 mmcf/d)


According to Operations this is already bi-directional . The only things are required on this one is to take the flapper out of the check-valve 
and blow down the gas in 5.33 miles of 12"".

Cost of gas loss& labor = $8,000




TW/ Lonestar at Pecos County ( 100 mmcf/d)

A): TW/ Lonestar interconnect


	Scope: On this one we need a bi-directional valve skid using the existing meter run.
	Cost of material& labor= $ 195,000


B): Pecos Compressor Station

    	 In order to make this interconnect bi-directional we also need to make the station ( two-compressor units) bi-directional.
	
Scope: Install outlet from Lonestar I/C to inlet filter with 12"" piping& valves. Unit discharge would be modified to
tie in to West Texas-20""
	
Cost for material& labor= $ 330,000.
	
If you need more accurate costs ( B -release) please let me know .

	Total cost estimate for this project = $ 533,000.

Endorse the recent CAL ISO report on causes of the problem (no utility 
forward buying, no demand responsiveness, etc) and say, with a few tweaks, 
their proposals were on target.

Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01.  Retroactive roll-off would be 
devastating.

Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier 
in place (get them out of merchant supply).

Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration.

Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of 
under-recoveries until out years. 

Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as 
possible, post '01.

Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts:
  Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be 
definitive.  Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the 
right numbers.

From a retail perspective, this blends protection of the book with 
advancement of new market opportunity.  I may still get more feedback from 
the EES guys, but wanted to give you what I got so far.

There is a 75% probability that customers who go to direct access and who 
used utility service between January and June 2001 will pay an exit fee 
calculated as the difference between market price and utility rates during 
that period.  The exit fee could also include the going forward costs or 
alternatively, those costs could be passed along in the form of a uniform 
surcharge.  In other words, with regard to past costs, regulators or 
legislators would require DA customers to pay the amount they belive had been 
sucked from the state during the January-June crisis period.  I said the 
""retroactive ratemaking"" argument is a nicety that California could easily 
dispense with.

Now that we know the CPUC decision will be delayed, I think the probability 
of exit fees for retroactive costs is even higher - either the DA legislation 
will pass between now and July 3, or Carl Wood will change the PUC order to 
get the ""jailbreaking"" customers to pay up. 
"
harry.kingerski@enron.com|"

CDWR has until 1/1/03 to fill the utility short position.  They will be doing 
the fill over that time, maybe up-front, maybe not.  DA should be allowed to 
proceed without inconvenience to CDWR so long as :

the net short to be filled minus the portion of the short already filled is 
greater than the direct access load.

In other words, say net short to be filled is 40% on a utility, at a given 
point in time the portion already filled is 30%, DA should proceed as long as 
it doesn't exceed 10% at that time.   The balance could be calculated weekly, 
if necessary, up to say September 1, 2002, at which time DA would definitely 
be closed.  If the amount available for DA is close to CDWR's remaining short 
to be filled, CDWR gives two weeks notice and DA is then suspended per 
Commission order before September 1, 2002.  

This approach makes the calculation utility specific, does not impede CDWR's 
efforts, gives the legislature maximum time to give a different DA fix, and 
gives the CPUC a graceful way out.  If the CPUC wanted to slam the door 
immediately, seems to me they would have done that in the draft order.

Let's collect comments on this and then see what AReM and others are up to."

Transmission net plant (as of 1999):
PG&E,  $1.43 B
SCE,     $1.90 B

Distribution net plant (as of 1999):
PG&E,  $6.58 B
SCE,     $4.88 B

Total costs (revenue requirement) for Transmission (1999):
PG&E, $0.40 B    includes return on capital (0.12B), taxes, depreciation, o&m 
(0.10B)
SCE,     $0.57 B   includes return on capital (0.15B), taxes, depreciation, 
o&m (0.21B)

Transmission costs as % of total utility costs (1999):
PG&E,  5% 
SCE,     7%

Securitization of entire transmission revenue stream creates maybe $20 
million annually of additional head room for the 2 utilities (2% of $1B), 
plus whatever tax effects may accrue from state vs. private ownership.

A 50% premium to book value purchase generates a $1.7 B combined windfall to 
utilities, before tax effects, or about 15% of the under-recovered amounts of 
$13 B. 

Alan and I will work on refining these messages."

Just wanna give you a heads up.  From Settlements we learned that there will be -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments in your book due to BPA and Modesto related deals .  I have researched on all the items and believe they are valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  If you don't disagree you shall expect to see this hit in your P&L for 8/31/01.

 

Please also note that there might be other items to come between now and the end of this month.  I will let you know when that happens.

Thanks,

Attached please find the latest prior month adjuments to be entered in your P&L for 11/30/01.  The total amount will be 
-$1,616.76.  The biggest negative item (-$162,309.44) is explained by Settlements as due to ""multiple deals DJ index settling"" as you can see in the attached detail sheet.  I have asked Settlements to provide more details (deal numbers) so it might better help us understand where this negative adjustment is from.  I will send you the deal numbers as soon as I found out.

Please also note the attached file is preliminary.  There could be more to come from Settlements between now and month-end.  I'll update you if that happens.  Please take a look at the items listed now and let me know if you have any questions.

Attached please find all prior month adjustments we've taken from April up to the end of July.  Please note that normally Risk only makes prior month adjustments at the end of each month, and I have tracked your p&l at the end of April, May, June, and July and all the month-to-date adjustments match what's showing up in the attached speadsheet.

In the mean time I have saved all June's P&L statements in ""M:\common\Power\Riskmgmt\west temp"" folder.  Please note this folder will be deleted when you are done reviewing, as all the P&L statements are highly confidential.

 

Please also note that although the Modesto annuities were entered in June and July they wouldn't go into your P&L on the dates the annuities were entered because the flow date for those deals were all for prior months (April, May, and June).  In other words, for deals entered with a flow date that's already passed, they will not go into your P&L unless Risk makes manual adjustments.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Please note that in addition to the -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments you've agreed in response to my prior email to you on 8/30, you will get +$6,594 for index price true up from deal #607801.  Therefore, the revised total adjustment you shall expect on 8/31/01's P&L is -$864,226.56.

Louise raised the idea that we may want to add a disclaimer that the content 
is provided by Sports.com.  I told her that we had an indemnification from 
them with respect to libel, etc.   Please let me know if you think we need to 
add this.

thanks

There would be a Euro 2000 icon on the EnronOnline quotes screen (the main 
page of our system).
The user would click on this icon, and a new browser window would open with 
the EnronOnline/Sports.com home page.  This will contain schedules, results, 
player profiles, etc.  It will also contain an icon for Minute Mania Contest.
When the user clicks on this icon, they would then go to a page that 
describes at a high level what the contest is.  Pick times for events (first 
goal, etc) and win prizes (digital video camera, etc).   We would also note 
here that the contest is only open to residents of UK, Germany, etc.  Click 
here to register.  
The user will then go to a screen that has several input boxes that include:  
Name, contact details (email, phone), user name for contest, and country of 
residence.  The country of residence box would either be a drop down that 
only includes choices for the countries that are eligible or would allow the 
user to type their country.  If the user has the ability to type their 
country then the system would then have a verification process that rejects 
those that are ineligible to participate.

The order of priority for the countries where we have users is:

UK
Germany
Belgium
Netherlands
Switzerland
Norway
Sweden
Finland
Denmark
Austria
Italy
Spain
France

Then there is also

US (largest customer base) -  state by state differences 
Canada (second largest group)
Australia
Japan

We also have users with guest ID's in Poland, Portugal, and Singapore. (we 
should confirm the laws here as well)

Please let me know if I can provide any further details.

thanks
Dave

EES was not agreeing to what we (Enron Power) has in Enpower.  Per Phil 
Platter our numbers are correct and the worksheet needs to be updated to 
reflect Enpower.

EES stated they will adjust their numbers once they get an updated sheet. 
Thanks,

I spoke with Virginia and we agreed that variances which are listed as part 
of the schedule I will forward to you.  All others will go in to DMS.

Please let me know what you find out.
