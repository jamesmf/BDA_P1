This deal is in under Short Term California, not Long Term Northwest, and the 
trader is Phil Platter, not Mike Swerzbin, and there is no broker. Are you 
sure this is the deal in question?

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal where:
Enron (Mike Swerzbin) buys from PPL Montana Cal'04-Cal'06 25 mw of Mid-C at 
$45.00 off-peak hours.

They did not tell me about this deal during checkout.  Can you please check 
with Mike.

Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new

precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only

Hi Kate, 

Can you please let Phil know that he should be testing deals in the enpower 
test database not the actual system.

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

deal?

Please let me know the outcome.

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from..

I do not see this deal in Enpower.  


When I checked out with Amerex on the 14th all deals were confirmed.  When I 
cleared their deals all deals were cleared.
It is our policy to go back and check their web site for additions, changes 
etc. once every week for the week before and this deal popped up.

Can you please check to see if the schedulers received any confirmation of 
flow for this deal from Coral?

That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today. 
Mike's exact words were, ""there's no way it's $258."" So if anyone from Prebon 
is still there, let them know the trader is sticking with his price.

559066I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as 
$258.00 on this deal.
559091Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as 
price and we show $358.

Please advice.

559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

guess the traders here had heard we were now doing our trades with Pinnacle, 
not APS. Is this incorrect? Do you know who might know about that?

Thanks,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for

the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880,

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris

517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

Let me know if you have questions.

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
as they are.

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

559091 is a Bloomberg deal under Matt Motley's book. I just talked to Mike

And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on 
their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade 
needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with

Can you please let Phil know that he should be testing deals in the enpower 
test database not the actual system.  

Thanks

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

And if it's at all possible to get the traders names from the brokers when 
they have missing deals, that would be wonderful. I can usually guess by 
using the information given, but sometimes the traders get busy and aren't 
exactly happy about being bugged for missing deals that aren't theirs. I'm 
not sure how it works, but Carla told me the brokers should give you all the 
information at their disposal. If they don't, or won't, let me know and I'll 
have our traders talk to them.

Subject: GPG Organization Announcement

ATTACHED IS AN IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SHOULD GO OUT TO ALL 
GPG EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY:

The timeliness and confidentiality of this announcement have made it 
impossible for us to use the Notes Team to handle distribution via e-mail, as 
would normally be the case.  As a result, please forward the message to 
everyone in your respective department(s).

Note to those of you whose departments include field locations:  We are 
sending the announcement to all field locations via burst FAX, so you should 
not need to e-mail copies.  Faxes will be distributed at approximately 10:30 
this morning.

Please call Lisa Costello (x31819) if you have any questions.

By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping 
and eHR Online.  Well it is almost upon us.  Some of the business units in 
GPG will implement self-service time entry but ET&S along with other business 
units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will 
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation, 
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new 
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper 
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period 
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new 
system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more time 
to complete payrolls.  If you have changes to your timesheet after you have 
submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary 
adjustments will be made the following pay period."

There is a new binder for EPE hourly deals for 2002. The deal sheets MUST be kept in this binder. We are currently missing the deal sheet for 12/30/01 to 01/01/02. Please be on the lookout for this sheet or sheets. Those who were on shift for that period will need to coordinate what deals were done and will need to reconstruct a sheet. 

These sheets are currently a main source of information on EPE for settlements. The deal sheets should be clear, concise, and should have information such as energy type, delivery point, who you spoke with and at what time.

I will be sending another email regarding EPE procedure and model updates for 2002.

We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.

Please use appropriate dollar and mw values. Below is JUST an example. When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.

	 
IMPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$49	$49	$74	99	149	174	199	249	249


EXPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01
		$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1


*NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE*

Please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids.

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.

	1.	All deals will be done under ST-Whourly. If there is lending, parking or a cut that corresponds to another book, we will make that deal for the entire strip (for 	example, W-BOM sells to EPE for HE 7-22all one deal). We will then sell or buy the appropriate amount of energy from Whourly to that book (this interdesk deal 	will not be routed). We will do the interdesk transaction as one deal and will enter deal strips with pricing for each hour or hours where appropriate and will include 	transmission charges when necessary. In Enpower, use strips wherever possible...try to avoid extending deals in scheduling.

	2. 	All imports and exports will be under the appropriate desk (for example ST-SW exporting from SP-15 to FC MUST be under ST-SW in CAPS).
	This will allow us to put everything under Whourly and have export/import fees paid for by the appropriate desk. Otherwise the Whourly book will be charged for 	wheeling and/or potentially congestion for other desks. When filling a Service customer (such as Wheelabrator or EES) we should pay for the import and export 	fees.

	3.	A ""skeleton"" of an inc sheet should be developed as soon as possible each day.  Sales/purchases to or from EES should be made for the day and 	immediately input into the service sheet. Likewise...Service deals/Lending/Parking should be put into the sheet for the day where possible.

I would like to implement all of these practices immediately. Effective HE 1 08/29/01, THIS is our new business practice. Spread the word. I am looking for more suggestions for improvements on our process. We will have a meeting on September 4 to discuss group direction and ideas for improvement. This will be an important meeting at 4 PM on Tuesday September 4th. Please plan to attend.

See me at any time with suggestions or comments.

As we have more and more cuts, we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique. (YES!)

 1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as ""confirmed"" (this will allow us to sort for cut or ""confirmed"" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.

2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING. On imports to CALI, please zero out the purchase outside of CALI, zero out the EpmiCalPool, and then make a purchase under the book that had the import (likely EPMI Short Term Cali) from the California Imbalance (remember no price and 24 POS on the group).

IF you have any questions, please call me. We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts, particularly imports into California.

As of HE2 this morning, our contract with MPC was ended. For the time being, we will no longer be balancing MPC's load.

Also, we can only purchase up to 100 mws from APS transmission. Please do not put wheels in to relieve congestion for over 100 mws. But do check the transmission availability on the website and maximize our ability to relieve congestion with APS in the Southwest. These should be the only congestion wheels that we run.

Also, please use PNM not AEP for any sleeving for EPE.

I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism.
1. Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials)
2. The CISO Table 1. lists an unintended consequence as "" Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver""
	Why is there no obligation to deliver?
3. Is there still a load deviation penalty? Or would that be considered seperately?

Thanks for the help.

There are two new paths for EPE information.

The first is for EPE schedules:
This path is P:/Trading/Real Time/El Paso Schedules/Admin/El Paso Schedules/2002/Feb02/EPE_FEB_02

The second is for the EPE models:
M:/Electric/EPE/EPE 2002/Models/February02/...

Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, Williams, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21. 

NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login. 

Following are a few pointers to help you get started. 

1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under ""Tools.""
2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose ""West"" and click ""Okay.""
3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.
4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule
5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the ""Control"" button and while selecting multiple rows.
6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.
7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called ""Cut Information"" will come up. Select the ""New Path Cut"" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.)
8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.

Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)"

We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well.
When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC (t) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately.  This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.  Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.  There will also be losses.  If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.  Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!  There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.  This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days.
Please see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Keoni,

Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.
 
I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.

I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.

I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.

I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.

I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.

I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.

I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.

I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.
Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.

At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.
I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.

While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.

I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. 


I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.

Thank you for your help.

We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE.  25 mws will be under ST-SW, 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM.

We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15.  25 mws will be under ST-WBOM, 40 mws will be under ST-CALI.

Both schedules are HE 7-22.  All deals should be under appropriate books.  Please take extra time with the EPE lending.  We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems.  Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate.

Thanks,

This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks.  I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it.  We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon.  I am working on adding you to the market status list, this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders.  Finally, I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks.  Boring, but important.

So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.

1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method)

2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.

3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.

4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be:
Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain Jack, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.

Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.

5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. 

	a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion managementthan an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four 	Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to 	Four Corners. 

	b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zonefor example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.

6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.

Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,

Bill"

Two totally different issues for you.

First:  When scheduling transmission on Portland General Electric from John Day to Malin we MUST use deal #146517, we MUST make the price zero.  We extend this deal in scheduling and change the delivery points.  We then make an annuity to ST-NW for losses.  Easy.

Second: For the third time in two weeks the behavior of the Real-Time Group after 6 PM has been brought up.  We will talk more regarding this in our meeting next week.  It is important to note that we need to remain within the bounds of professional behavior at all times.  Enron has a zero tolerance policy regarding harassment (language or behavior that offends or belittles others).

Thanks for your attention.

Mike ,as we have discussed several times Amec will perform the work based on trhe rate schedules provided ton date with a lump sum based on the estimated hours times these rates.This does not mean we will provide the profit/overhead /bare wage breakdowns as described herein.We also said we would execute work in overrun at 60% of the scedule rates.This is what was discussed and written into the latest documents we reviewed last Friday.I am available in Toronto for awhile this a.m. at 905-8295400 ext.2489 if we need to discuss again.

Recently there have been complaints regarding chew in the kitchen sink, chew scattered around the edge of garbage cans, and chew spit cups left on desks. Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products, we are the most visible. The relaxed atmosphere of our group is a priviledge and I expect each person in the group to be responsible for the appearence of our desk and the perception of our desk by others on our floor. Leaving chew spit cups on other desks or throwing chew in the sink is unacceptable. It is a simple thing.

1.) Notes as usual

2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY importantAll CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).

3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just ""bow out"" gracefully if you have no other options with the words ""L - D's.""

4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.

Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE. Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.

This will probably not be a fun weekend. 
I appreciate your help.

I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.  From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.  I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.  Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday.  I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.  Overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.  Feel free to see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

It is always fun to come home to someone who is

I am so glad to know that you sound so happy and things are finally getting  back to normal all around. What will happen to your stock now or do you know  yet?
Any news of Laura - please tell her I am thinking alot about her!
Have a super, super time in Vegas and put a quarter in a slot for me!

Sounds like you had a great time in New Orleans.  I'm glad that you are both spending lots of time together. The package was late  because of all the security at the airports and sounds like you got a taste of  that!
Why is Enron still on a downhill slide? I thought  that when Ken took over again you would see an improvement immediately. What is  the forcast for this last quarter? I know all of you are sick about the stock  prices.
You can call me on Friday - just e-mail me the time  and I will be sure to be at the office. The number is 053-256-098. Remember we  are 7 hours ahead now.
Lots of love and hugs - Mom and  Dad

Hi Everyone!

I thought I would share my pictures. Just picked them up today.
I think everyone appears really happy to have welcomed
Mackenzie into our family!  This is the day she came home
from the hospital!

Love,

Subject:	RE: KS Management - Texas DRAFT ONLY


Kay,

Thank you for the revised contract.  I would like to say that it was a
pleasure meeting you, and I have enjoyed our discussions on the telphone.

I would like to take this opportunity to be upfront with you.  Kelsey's
corporate philosophy is to adopt a customer-driven focus.  So when Kelsey is
a customer, our strong preference is to deal with companies that demonstrate
a customer-driven focus in negotiations  our experience has been that
companies that demonstrate this focus in negotiations also demonstrate this
focus in service.

However, we have strong reservations that Enron does not take concerns of
potential customers seriously.  This concern manifested itself at our
meeting and, given the paucity of approved changes in the contract, has been
heightened.

Thus, we have made the decision that Kelsey should obtain its energy from a
non-Enron source.  I would like to emphasize that the decision is no
reflection on you; in fact, prior to our meeting, you had very nearly
convinced us that Kelsey should use Enron.

Good luck with your other customers.  Having met you, I know that you will
be successful in all of you endeavors.  If you wish to discuss this further,
please do not hesitate to call.

Nicholas Ro
Vice President &
Chief Compliance Officer

Hey Family!

This year I am going to do something I have never done before...start
shopping early.  In order to do that, I need to know what everyone would
like for Christmas.  Please do not reply back and tell me you don't need
anything, because I know there is something out there that you would like.
Please e-mail or give me a call soon so I can get started!

                                Love, Heather

P.S. Also let me know what your spouses would like too.

1. On April 13, 2000, a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of 
Limited Partnership of KN Marketing, L.P.  was filed with the Texas Secretary 
of State, changing the name of the limited partnership to ""ONEOK Texas Gas 
Marketing, L.P."".    On May 4, 2000, a Certificate of Amendment to the 
Certificate of Limited Partnership of ONEOK Texas Gas Marketing Company, 
L.P.   was filed with the Texas Secretary of State, changing the name of the 
limited partnership to ""ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P.""

2. On April 27, 2000, a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of 
Incorporation of ONEOK Gas Marketing Company was filed with the Delaware 
Secretary of State,  changing the name of the corporation to ""ONEOK Energy 
Marketing and Trading Company, II""  (""ONEOK II"").


NOT YET EFFECTIVE    BUT FYI

 We have Master Agreements in place with each of these entities.   We have 
sent to ONEOK a Transfer and Termination Agreement under which  the following 
will occur once it becomes effective.

1. Oneok II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master 
Agreement to Oneok L.P.

2. The ONEOK LP Master Agreement will be terminated and all trades will be 
done under the ONEOK II Master Agreement.


In summary, once the Transfer and Termination Agreement becomes effective, 
all trades will be done with ONEOK LP under the ONEOK II Master Agreement 
that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes from the parent ONEOK Inc.    
We will let you know when this becomes effective.

Bob, 

Go ahead and accept the nom revision.  I believe that this is with PGE, not 
El Paso.  How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?  I f they have a 
higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom 
there.  In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as 
possible to what we have in the system now.

Subject: HPL Meter #986563 Texaco Fee c/P

Daren:

During the period of 12/1/99 through 3/31/00 gas flowed into HPL's pipeline 
at the above meter.  The gas volumes that flowed are as follows:

12/1/99 - 12/31/99                   1,457  Mmbtus
01/1/00 - 01/31/00                         49  Mmbtus
02/1/00 - 02/29/00               7  Mmbtus
03/1/00 - 03/31/00               4  Mmbtus

         1,517  Mmbtus

Prior to 12/1/99, the volumes were being purchased from High Sierra Operating 
LLC under contract #96003435  Deal #26611 which have terminated.  Currently, 
Logistics has these volumes recorded to HPL Stranger Gas Contract.  In order 
to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a new deal to record these 
volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline, or Logistics needs approval to 
write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.  (Please print, sign, 
and return the original to Clem Cernosek).

The following are my answers to your questions:

1.  No.

2.  The nomination is at the pay meter 9862.

3.  In the past, this purchase has not been listed on the spreadsheet.  It has been 	      maintained by the Risk group.

4.  As of 4/24/01, Comstock's nomination is 43,681 and Kerr McGee's is 29,037.

5.  This purchase is not listed on the spreadsheet.  It is maintained separately on a file by Daren.  To the best of my knowledge it is a good wellhead purchase.

Bob,

Questions based on the information in the Facilitation by Location Report:

1.  Meter 9643 HGPL/HPL - Stratton, Tejones Operating Corporation, sitara 266970:  Should this purchase be at meter 9638, FREEMAN PROD-MAXINE FIELD in Trade Zone 18?

2.  I presume we are not counting BOTH Meter 9848 NORTH PADRE ISLAND BLK8 and Meter 9862 LEHMAN/SPINNAKER ONSHORE.  Isn't this the same gas?

3. Meter 3536 SEAHAWK/A-S (MAT PLT 520), EOG Resources, sitara 725391:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

4.  Meter 6884 PGTT JUNCTION 16"" LEASE, Comstock Oil & Gas, Inc. and Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Onshore L.P., sitara 125899 and 132975:  Comstock's volume should exceed Kerr-McGee's volume, and together the two volumes should be approximately 73,000/d.  Currently, Comstock's volume is only 8,600/d and Kerr-McGee's volume is 25,000/d.   We look about 38,000/d short.

5.  Meter 639 HANNAH NASH, Coral Energy Resources, L.P., sitara 659998:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

I'm looking at about 10 other old deals that I think should be in for May, but aren't.  In addition, I'm adding in the new deals that will flow in May.  I'll be done by noon.

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated 
during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it 
is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for 
this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

California Electricity Management Agency Approves Temporary Power Plants

California

Reporter (TM) 

State electricity managers voted Wednesday to pay private companies as much 
as $765 million over three years to build and run temporary power plants 
aimed at preventing blackouts next summer.

The Independent System Operator, the agency that controls 75 percent of the 
state's power grid, said it had no choice but to approve the plants, which 
can generate a combined 2,000 megawatts  enough to power 2 million homes. 
Even with those new plants, the estimated demand for electricity next summer 
exceeds supplies by about 3,000 megawatts. 

Calling the state's deregulated electricity market ""a complete train wreck,"" 
board members said they needed to act immediately.

Under legislation passed last month, smaller plants can be approved in as 
little as four months. But applications for those plants have to be submitted 
by Oct. 31.

The plants, which can be built by June 2001, are more expensive to run and 
pollute more than larger plants. They will only run on days of peak demand.

The cost of building and running the new plants likely will be passed on to 
ratepayers, but the details have not been worked out. Board members could not 
say how much it would cost each consumer.

Electricity prices surged this summer when demand for power exceeded 
supplies. Under deregulation, which began in 1998, the ISO pays whatever it 
deems necessary to buy more electricity in an emergency. The agency has spent 
more than $100 million this year for such purchases, a cost paid by consumers 
in their bills.

Consumer advocates said the vote to approve so-called peaker plants signals a 
partial re-regulation of the state's electricity market. Companies building 
the plants will be paid a guaranteed return of 16.6 percent for at least 
three years. ISO staff will choose them from among 69 companies that 
submitted bids.

One consumer advocate, however, said the move could protect the ISO from 
spending even more.

""We're recognizing that it's not going to be appropriate to just let the 
market function willy-nilly, because it may fail,"" said Michael Shames, 
executive director of Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""Given 
the extreme we're at, a little more regulation makes it a little more 
reasonable.""

USA: U.S. electric utilities want new depreciation rules. 
? 
09/26/2000 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. utilities want federal tax laws changed 
to allow electric generation facilities to be depreciated over seven years 
instead of the current 15-20, an industry trade group told a House 
subcommittee on Tuesday.

Officials from the Alliance of Energy Suppliers, the energy supply division 
of the Edison Electric Institute, said rapid deregulation and consolidation 
in the industry made the old depreciation rules obsolete, and hurt the 
sector's ability to attract investment for new plant construction. 

Under the old school, regulated market structure, dividend payments to 
utility investors were more or less predictable, but that was no longer the 
case in openly competitive markets.

""Previously applicable rules regarding the recovery of capital simply do not 
apply any longer,"" said Theodore Vogel, vice president and tax counsel for 
DTE Energy Co , a member of the industry alliance.

""Investors will demand a return of, and a higher return on, their investments 
in building and maintaining power plants over a much shorter period of time,"" 
he said.

Some 24 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws to open their 
retail markets to competition. Wholesale markets have been gradually 
deregulated by the federal government.

Vogel said demand for power is great and growing, noting that 16 percent of 
U.S. energy consumption could be attributed to increases in information 
technology and telecommunications.

U.S. demand for power is expected to grow at a rate of more than 5 percent a 
year, he said.

New supply is lagging, however, notably in states where deregulation has seen 
consumers pay market rates for power for the first time, like in California, 
where price caps had to be introduced in San Diego this summer after electric 
bills tripled and caused a public outcry.

""Congress should legislate incentives to encourage the construction of new or 
more efficient electric generation facilities,"" Vogel said.

The Edison Electric Institute is the trade group for the nation's 
shareholder-owned electric utilities.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Nevada governor Kenny Guinn will decide by early 
next week on whether to implement electricity deregulation by November, as 
recommended by the state's Public Utilities Commission, a spokesman for the 
governor said Monday.   

Deregulation was set to become law March 1, 2000, but was stalled due to a 
lawsuit brought by Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) Co. unit Nevada power that 
challenged deregulation as unconstitutional. Nevada Power withdrew the 
lawsuit after the state approved a $110 million rate increase for the 
utility's customers. 

Guinn's spokesman would not say why the governor was considering a delay in 
deregulation.   

""All those details will be discussed when the decision is announced,"" said 
spokesman Jack Finn.   

The PUC's proposed deregulation schedule calls for competition to begin with 
large commercial customers on Nov. 1, 2000, followed by medium commercial 
customers April 1, 2001, and residential customers Sept. 1, 2001.

Calif Regulators Ask Utils For Extensive Financial Info
By Mark Golden
? 
10/12/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The California Public Utilities Commission has 
requested extensive financial information from the state's three 
investor-owned utilities and their parent companies. 
Administrative law judge Angela Minkin ruled the information should be given 
in response to a pleading by PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX), 
which want the PUC to change deregulation rules to allow them to recover the 
enormous losses they are now incurring in wholesale electricity markets. 
""Minkin has directed the utilities by Oct. 17 to go open-kimono with all of 
their financial data since 1998 and, in some cases, since 1997,"" said Daniel 
Douglass, a partner in the law firm Arter & Hadden LLP, which is representing 
most of the state's independent power producers, the California Power 
Exchange and some of nonutility retail electricity providers in the 
proceedings. 
The judge's request covers numerous revenue accounts, asset values of power 
plants still owned by the utilities, documents on assets transferred and 
significant payments made from the regulated utilities to unregulated 
subsidiaries, bond information, and net earnings for the parent companies and 
all subsidiaries for each quarter between 1997 and 2000. 
Minkin also requested an itemization of funds paid to and amounts billed by 
any entity other than the California ISO, the state's grid operator, and the 
California PX, the state's power exchange, for power purchased in California 
by the utilities and their affiliates. 
In addition, the judge wants a description of all utility affiliates' 
activities in California electric markets and signed affidavits by the 
utilities' officers attesting to the veracity of the information. 
""The information will also permit the Commission to evaluate recent claims to 
investors and the media by PG&E and Edison that their power purchase 
liabilities have undermined their financial integrity,"" Minkin wrote in the 
ruling. ""The seriousness of these claims imposes a responsibility on 
regulators to fully evaluate the utilities' financial circumstances on behalf 
of utility customers and the state."" 
A combination of surging wholesale power prices and caps on retail rates has 
produced billions of dollars losses at Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern 
California Edison, the regulated units of PG&E and Edison International. 
The utilities want the ability to recover those losses after the transition 
to deregulation and its fixed-rate regime end in 2002. 
Failure to supply the information could result in fines, Minkin wrote. 
It would also likely jeopardize the utilties' chance of succeeding in getting 
the rules changed, Western Power Trading Forum's Douglass said. 
""If the utilities want to have these decisions modified, they need to 
document the financial straits they're in,"" Douglass said. ""If they don't 
provide, they open up themselves up to losing their request."" 
The extensiveness of the disclosures is similar to that in the subpoenas 
issued to many Western Power Trading Forum member companies in other 
investigations of California's wholesale power market. Douglass said the 
information would be available to all parties to the proceedings. 
Douglass said the utilities haven't yet objected to the ruling, which was 
issued late Friday. 
Southern California Edison declined to comment Thursday.

Foster said SoCal Edison is being forced to borrow millions of dollars to 
cover the difference between what it pays for wholesale power and what it 
charges its customers during the rate freeze. 
The company's stock has been taking a beating in recent weeks as Wall Street 
learned about the utility's $2 billion debt. 
Current wholesale power prices are about 20 cents/KWh, but the utility 
charges its customers about 3 to 4 cents/KWh. 
That could end if SoCal Edison convinces state regulators that it recovered 
its stranded costs related to the sale of its power plants. 
The utility's recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission 
suggests that the pending sale of its hydro generating assets will allow it 
to end the rate freeze and start charging its customers market-based rates. 
But Foster said the company wants to protect its customers. 
""We believe the rate freeze is going to end sooner or later and consumers 
cannot be exposed to a volatile market,"" Foster said. ""Our primary goal is to 
protect consumers and provide them with affordable, reliable and predictable 
rates."" 
Still, the utility is going to have to convince state regulators of its 
intentions. Foster said the company will file with the Public Utilities 
Commission soon, possibly to lift the rate freeze, based on the pending sale 
of its hydro assets, and to raise its rates. 
""We don't want to have California in a state of chaos,"" Foster said. ""We hope 
to have a cooperative agreement with state regulators when the time comes.""

As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) plans to raise additional capital to offset 
the mounting costs of wholesale energy in the California market and complete 
the divestiture of its generation assets, allowing it to charge its retail 
customers market rates, according to filings the company has made at the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In an 8-K filing, PGOCorp. told the SEC that its utility subsidiary may issue 
long-term debt to finance the high costs of wholesale electricity that 
plagued California's deregulated market this summer. In addition, PGOfiled an 
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) on Sept. 8 
requesting the authority to raise an additional $1.4 billion in short-term 
financing, it told the SEC. This would be in addition to $1.7 billion in 
short-term financing that the PUC has allowed PGOto raise, as well as an 
existing $1 billion revolving credit facility the company has used to support 
commercial paper issuance.

SoCal Ed To Consider Litigation To Recover Power Costs

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Southern California Edison said if the state's 
Public Utilities Commission doesn't allow the utility to recover about $2 
billion in unpaid power costs when a state imposed rate freeze is lifted it 
will consider litigation to ensure recovery of electricity costs, according 
to a filing made late Monday with the Security and Exchange Commission.   

""The CPUC has denied requests by (Southern California Edison) and other 
California utility companies to allow recovery of the transition revenue 
account undercollections after the end of the statutory rate freeze,"" the SEC 
filing states. ""These decisions pre-dated the unforseen run-up in wholesale 
market prices beyond the level of prices that should have been produced by 
functioning competitive markets."" 

SoCal Edison consumers are currently paying a fixed rate for electricity as 
required by the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law, which is far below 
the 20 cent/KWh wholesale rate SoCal Edison pays to procure the power from 
energy producers. As a result, the company's debt is growing by several 
million dollars a day.   

If the company is unable to recoup the money from its ratepayers, 
shareholders would be responsible for the costs, said SoCal Edison chief 
financial officer John Scilacci.   

The company would go to court seeking authority to have its customers pay 
back the debt, if required, rather than hold its shareholders liable, 
Scilacci said.   

SoCal Edison said in the SEC filing that it has used ""virtually all of its 
CPUC-authorized capacity for short-term borrowing.""   

The utility is restructuring its loan arrangements to allow for additional 
""short-term borrowing capacity to meet its liquidity needs.""   

The utility has recently received a negative rating from several Wall Street 
debt rating agencies.

The common response to neighbourhood landfill? ""Not in my backyard."" But 
waste may soon grow more attractive  as an alternative way to light your 
home and heat your furnace.

This energy will come from methane gas, collected through vertical wells and 
horizontal trenches in landfill sites. Suncor Energy Inc., the Alberta 
oilsands giant, has signed a five-year agreement with Conestoga Rovers and 
Associates (CRA) of Waterloo, Ont., which specializes in tapping this gas 
from landfills. Over five years, Suncor will pour up to $60 million into the 
project. Suncor vice-president Gerry Manwell says individual sites will cost 
up to $10 million to develop, making a profit within about five years. Only 
six of Canada's 392 landfills are being reviewed for development, but if the 
public embraces the new gas, its commercial viability should inspire other 
companies to follow suit. 

In the past, such a venture would not have been profitable, says Rick Mosher, 
project leader at CRA. But that may be about to change. Come November, when 
Alberta and Ontario deregulate their electricity industries, power will be a 
marketable commodity like natural gas. Conventional electricity may get 
pricier, opening the door for alternatives. Toronto Hydro Corp. has already 
announced plans to buy 130 million kilowatt hours produced from green energy, 
including methane.

So those decaying kitchen scraps and lawn cuttings may soon provide both 
fuel, for heating and generating electricity, and carbon dioxide, which will 
be sold to nurture seedlings in greenhouses. That's good news for consumers, 
who will be empowered to help reduce the noxious smell and greenhouse gas 
emissions from the landfill in their ""backyard.""

California is fast becoming the symbol for problems that can develop when the 
electric utility industry is deregulated.

Since becoming the first state to deregulate its retail market, California 
has had several power shortages this summer in which consumers were hit with 
skyrocketing electric rates. In San Diego, rates doubled and even quadrupled 
in the last two months. There's so much public backlash that members of 
Congress from California will hold hearings this month to examine the 
problem. 

Trade groups that represent the utility companies and public power 
organizations say deregulation is not at fault, but rather the specific way 
in which California opened its markets without accounting for supply and 
demand. They say there's not enough power generation to meet demand.

The state hasn't built any power plants for at least 10 years, in large part 
because of the resistance utilities face from environmentalists concerned 
about siting locations.

The National Energy Marketers Association, which represents wholesale and 
retail energy marketers, warned that suggestions about placing price caps for 
wholesale power markets would backfire. Instead, the group says Congress and 
states should eliminate regulations that harm competition in wholesale and 
retail power markets.

The group says the problem has been exacerbated by policies that increase the 
risk to build new power plants and a lack of uniformity for operating 
procedures and other requirements.

California's utility problems have also become an issue in the presidential 
campaign. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader has called on the state 
legislature and Gov. Gray Davis to pass a rate rollback law that doesn't 
include a balloon payment to compensate utilities for the money they would 
lose during a rate decrease.

""Electricity deregulation really brings about a collision of interests,"" 
Nader said. ""It pits the interests of consumers - who are often unorganized 
and lack power against the interests of supplierswho are usually very 
organized, powerful and have a lot of money behind them. It shouldn't be that 
way.""

Energy Issues Divide Bush, Gore

For the first time in 20 years, energy issues could emerge as a major issue 
in the presidential campaign. Both major candidates are trying to use the 
issue to their advantage.

The Democrats argue that Texas Gov. George W. Bush and running mate Dick 
Cheney - who are well-known figures in the oil industry - are in the back 
pockets of oil companies that have lobbied to drill on more public lands.

Republicans have criticized Vice President Gore for failing to develop a plan 
to address the country's long-term energy needs. The Republicans say that 
Gore and his running mate Joseph Lieberman are more concerned about winning 
the support of environmentalists than they are in developing an energy policy.

Gore and Lieberman support the development of alternative energy sources and 
tax credits for energy-efficient vehicles. They also have promised to block 
energy companies from drilling for oil or natural gas in the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska or along the coasts of California and Florida.

Bush and Cheney favor increased domestic oil production to reduce U.S. 
dependence on foreign oil. Bush says he backs the moratorium on new drilling 
in Florida and California, but supports oil exploration in the Arctic refuge.

Both Gore and Bush support new federal regulations that would require lower 
sulfur levels in gasoline and cleaner engines in cars.

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  

   

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)-  Electricity customers in several Western states 
are getting cold feet about their upcoming deregulation deadlines after 
watching San Diegans' bills more than double under deregulation this summer. 

The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission held a public meeting Tuesday to 
discuss consumers' requests for a delay in that state's scheduled Jan. 1, 
2002, deregulation start date.   

""Everyone is worried about the fly-up in wholesale and retail prices in San 
Diego as the result of a tight market, so they're asking for a delay until 
more supply can be secured,"" said John Curl, director of the PRC's utility 
division.   

In Nevada, Governor Kenny Guinn has postponed signing that state's 
deregulation schedule several times amid pressure from legislators concerned 
about higher rates for constitutents. Guinn is expected to make a decision by 
early next week, which means deregulation could get underway as soon as Nov. 
1, 2000.   

Oregon has also taken California's troubles seriously. Under electricity 
restructuring rules adopted late last month, large industrial and 
nonresidential customers will deregulate starting Oct. 1, 2001, but 
residential and small commercial customers will still get a regulated rate.   

""This is the first big step in implementing electric restructuring in Oregon 
in a unique way that is very different from what California and other states 
have done,"" said Oregon Public Utilities Commission chairman Ron Eachus.

You pinch pennies, wait for sales, and compare prices. But have you  ever 
gone shopping to lower your utility bills? A handful of Internet  companies 
are hoping you will in the next few years.  

The fledgling companies already are saving money for consumers in the  
handful of states that have deregulated electric power and natural gas.  They 
expect a flood of interest as more states deregulate. In the  meantime, 
they're luring new customers with cut- rate deals on other  services from 
long-distance telephone service to satellite television  and even gasoline. 

Their formula: Lure hundreds of thousands of bill-payers to a single  Web 
site where they can find great deals.  

""It is the Web that has made it possible for consumers to come together  
nationwide,"" says Sanjay Chopra, chairman and chief executive of  
OnlineChoice.com, a Pittsburgh-based Internet service. ""The power has  
shifted - and we're enabling that process - from the producers to  
consumers.""  

""Every month you have these bills. They're unavoidable,"" adds Matt Coffin, 
chief executive and founder of LowerMyBills.com, based in Los Angeles. ""Who 
wants to pay more than they need to for monthly bills?""

The message is catching on. In a year, LowerMyBills has grown from nothing to 
a marketplace of more than 250,000 people who are looking to  cut costs. The 
site bills itself as a marketplace for utility- type  services. Online users 
can select among three long-distance services  that charge anywhere from 4.9 
cents to 6.9 cents a minute. If they sign  up, LowerMyBills gets a 
commission.  

The company also offers Internet access and low-interest credit cards,  as 
well as electric power and natural gas in some deregulated states.  If 
homeowners signed up for all of the services the company offered,  they would 
save an average $3,000 a year apiece, Mr. Coffin claims.  

""It's not just cost or price that attracts customers to our  marketplace,"" 
says Paul Lewis, president of Essential.com, an online  energy and 
communications marketplace. ""They're also looking for  convenience."" The 
Burlington, Mass. company sends customers their bills  online and charges 
their credit-card accounts, saving them time but  also reducing the company's 
costs.  

Sometimes the companies are independent, such as OnlineChoice,  LowerMyBills, 
and Essential.com, as well as Utility.com, based in  Emeryville, Calif.; and 
GreenMountain.com, a South Burlington, Vt.  provider of environmentally 
cleaner energy. Sometimes, they're tied to  big energy companies. In May, for 
example, Enron Corporation joined  forces with America Online and IBM Corp. 
to begin selling electricity  and natural gas. The company, dubbed the New 
Power Company, is  marketing its services via the Internet to customers in 
Pennsylvania  and New Jersey.   

OnlineChoice.com uses a slightly different strategy. It pools together  
potential customers and then goes out and negotiates the best possible  deal 
for them. For example, 70,000 consumers agreed to register (with  no 
obligation) for long-distance telephone service. That customer base  was 
enough to convince GTC Telecom to offer members a price break: 4.7  cents a 
minute with no monthly fees or minimums.  

The company has also attracted a buying pool of 65,000 consumers for  cheaper 
electricity. Currently, the company offers such deals in some  seven states. 
But the pace of reform remains slow.  

Even in some of the states that have deregulated, competition hasn't  
flourished. Pennsylvania set prices for traditional utilities so low  that 
new companies found it difficult to compete. In Massachusetts,  pricing 
problems also caused only a small fraction of customers - 0.4  percent last 
year - to switch. And most of them were large businesses.  

Analysts expect more states to deregulate soon, which should open up  still 
more business for the online discounters.   

By 2005, more than a quarter of online households will use the Internet  to 
trim their energy bills, according to the Yankee Group. 

""There are a number of very appealing markets that are opening up to  
competition,"" says Bob Potter, vice president of business development  for 
energy for Essential.com. ""The regulations that they're putting in  place are 
better."" (c) Copyright 2000. The Christian Science Publishing Society Folder

Consolidated Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities urged federal energy 
regulators yesterday to reform New York State's wholesale electricity market 
to reduce energy prices.

The utility companies, blamed by  many of their customers for this summer's 
high electricity bills, contended that they were not responsible for the 
higher charges, which they called the result of excessively high wholesale 
energy costs in the state's deregulated electricity market. 

The utilities' request came in papers filed with the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission in a proceeding involving the New York State 
Independent System Operator, which administrates the wholesale energy market 
in the state.

Among the changes the two utilities urged was revision of Independent System 
Operator ''market rules and procedures that discourage economically efficient 
imports'' of electricity from other regions, like New England. They also 
called for changes in rules power generators must follow, to avoid severe 
day-to-day fluctuation in electricity prices. Joseph P. Fried

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)-State regulators voted Tuesday to allow Southern 
California Edison to raise its short-term borrowing ability for the purchase 
of wholesale electricity to $2 billion from $700 million, a company spokesman 
said. 
In its motion, the Edison International (EIX) unit said it needed to increase

Public Utilities Commission president Loretta Lynch. 
State and federal investigations are underway to determine why wholesale

From: Petrostrategies 

California's power generators blame the 'rigid nature' of the deregulated 
energy sector for the prevailing electricity crisis, which has seen wholesale 
power prices jump by as much as $500/Mwhr from $150/Mwhr in summer 1999 even 
as retail prices have been frozen until March 2002. Meanwhile, since demand 
has grown by a mere 3% from mid-1999, some consumers fear that the crisis has 
arisen, not from Californian deregulation, but from power generators who are 
taking advantage of the crisis to earn more. Tasked to act on the problem, 
FERC is to announce the results of its probe on the energy crisis by 
11/1/2000.

The Homestretch
Trying to hit the oil button while it is hot, Texas Gov. George W. Bush plans 
to unveil an energy plan Friday.  Larry Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economics 
adviser, says it would focus on increasing domestic energy production, 
promoting conservation and coaxing more production out of oil-exporting 
nations.  A particular focus will be on streamlining the granting of  permits 
for construction of refineries, pipelines and power plants.  Mr. Bush says 
the Clinton-Gore administration has clogged the permitting process, helping 
produce shortfalls in supply of home-heating oil and electricity production."

Oneok is okay with our form of guarantee, they do not want to make any changes to our form.  As a result they requested that we issue said guarantee, the relevant information is listed below.

Have we completed our review of their language?  I hope that we can coordinate the incoming and outgoing for the same time.

Before I call Don, I just want to confirm with you that your understanding is 
that we will assist EES in putting their publications on their own site.  In 
other words, Don would need to appoint his own people - an IT person to build 
the site (which we can assist with) and someone to research all their 
publications to see whether they're available electronically.  The EES Marcom 
group sent me 33 publications which they subscribe to and before I call Don 
to tell him he needs an EES person to take care of these, I want to make sure 
you and I have the same understanding.  We briefly talked about this before, 
but I want to be certain.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: mkt thoughs  

The most significant aspect of the syncrude production problem is the unique 
blending qualities of the sweet crude produced by the plant. The synthetic 
crude produced by this plant has no bottoms. All other crude oils have at 
least some bottoms, therefore the demand on the replacement blending barrel 
will be higher than the volume of barrels lost. With the plant production 
down approximately 3.5 to 4.0 millions barrels, the impact ultimately will be 
an increase of wti demand during the Oct. 15-nov 15  approaching 130,000 b/d. 
Given the tightness of light sweet crude oil in padd 2, I believe this is 
significant. I think it was the main reason for x/z strengthening and the 
recent strength in z/f may also be attributed to this recent supply 
disruption. Until there are additional sweet barrels arbed into padd 2 from 
padd 3, I think we will see strength in the prompt spreads.

Subject: Out of Office

I have been selected by Enron to attend a two week Global Consulting Alliance 
HR Leadership Program in Ann Arbor.  I'll be out of the office beginning 
Monday, October 2, returning on Monday, October 16.

In my absence, Shanna Funkhouser will be handling all EGM issues.  David 
Oxley has offered his assistance during this 2 week period as well.  I will 
be in touch with both Shanna and David while I'm gone to address any critical 
issues.  I have asked Shanna to attend the EGM OOC Staff Meetings in my 
absence.  

On another note, and I recognize there are signficant business issues you 
both are dealing with, but we need to start thinking about the PRC process.  
Specific questions that EGM business heads have asked are:

 With the exception of VP's and above, do we want to isolate EGM employees 
and review them only within EGM, regardless of location?

 Or, do we want to segregate those EGM employees below VP that were formerly 
EEL or ENA and review them separately with EEL or ENA?

  (ex., Europe, Singapore, Sydney, etc. employees review with EEL;  North 
American based employees review with ENA

 We'll have to integrate the former CALME employees as well.

 
Shawna and I have ascertained that your management team would prefer a 
separate EGM PRC so employees can be evaluated with peers in global emerging 
markets, rather than with mature (and high revenue generating) markets like 
North America gas and power.

Obviously, this is your call.  But time is growing near to plan for whatever 
direction we decide to go in.  The PRC system opens for feedback on approx. 
10/20/00.  PRC meetings need to be held between 11/20/00 and 12/15/00.

Thanks,

Cindy

Calling in on the 2nd should be fine.  Sorry that it doesn't work for you to 
be there in person.

I'm going to be out of the office from about 3:00 this afternoon until 11:00 
tomorrow morning, EST.  If your meeting happens after 11:00 EST tomorrow, I 
would like to join by phone.   (But don't worry about scheduling around me if 
it's a problem).  Donald is on his way back from South America, and probably 
isn't available.  Scott may be available by phone and probably would be 
interested in participating.

Maybe the next person we hire should be a full-time schedule coordinator.   
Thanks for your enduring patience.

Sue,

We're looking at evaluating our network metrics vs. other carriers.  Most of 
the information I have found 
centers on reach (i.e. miles of fiber, presence, etc.) as opposed ot 
performance or reliability.  Has anything 
crossed your attention in the Regulatory space that looks at this type of 
issue?

FYI.  Information from EBS on DSL Economics.  

At prices under $50/month (for DSL and ISP service), the article says that 
payback is only 12 months [Don't follow this necessarily because $600 first 
year Capex with only $600 of fees].

Clearly if you add on installation and potentially internal wiring fixes 
(moving a phone jack to the TV set) this only makes it harder to work. 

Also, interesting to note that Cable Modems are at least 10x faster than ADSL 
(why not go that route)?

		 Subject: Re: Set Up LLC for CLEC Activity

Sue,

Jim wants to think about this some more.  He's concerned about retaining both 
Enron Telecommunications, Inc. (""ETI"") and Enron Telecommunications Services, 
LLC (""ETS, LLC"").  As I recall, we decided to retain ETI because every state 
regulatory authority may not accept a LLC , therefore, retaining ETI, our 
existing  ""C"" corporation entity, for those jurisdictions gives us more 
flexibility.  We also need to confirm that, if a state regulatory authority 
does accept a LLC, then they will also accept a partnership tax return, (Form 
1065), from that LLC, rather than requiring the LLC's members (the owners) to 
forward copies of their corporate tax returns (Forms 1120).  Could you please 
confirm this with your outside counsel?

As I think about it, if the state regulatory authorities will accept a LLC's 
partnership tax returns (Forms 1065), then a better structure would be for 
ETS, LLC to be 99.9% owned by EBS, Inc., (17H) and 0.1% owned by ETI (77P).

I'll keep you informed.  Please let me know what you learn from your outside 
counsel.

		 Subject: tax issues

Suea suggestion for discussion at our next weekly call.  As one of our 
Illinios IXC certification reporting requirements, EBS must file an 
application/registration with the Illinois Dept of Revenue and presumably 
will need to pay taxes to the the State of Illinois.  Our lawyer passed on 
the form to be completed, and Tracy had sent it to the tax department in 
Portland.  There seems to be ongoing confusion as to who should actually file 
this document (I would argue that the EBS tax department is the group that 
needs to do so, as well as establish an ongoing relationship with the folks 
at the Dept of Revenue) and who administratively needs to set up a system to 
handle any interaction with the Revenue dept. 

Since our IXC certifcations have only started to take place in 2000 this 
issue may not have hit the tax department before,  but I've got to believe 
that just about every state in the union is going to want to tax us on 
something, so I think we need to explore the issue further.  Could you please 
add to our agenda for next week?

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

I met with Roger Westbrook on Friday about the Bridgeline easements.  We figured out what info we already have and what we still need.  Attached is an email from Roger to Joel Milliet from Bridgeline regarding what we still need.  

I am working with Roger on putting together the ROW agreement.  I will send it to you for review once we were are done.  Roger is out of town this week so you can probably expect something from us by the middle of next week.  In the meantime, could you please put together the special warranty deed for the sale of the 2.82 acres to Bridgeline?  The price agreed on is $6500/acre. 

Talk to you soon,

Rakhi

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this.  I have sent an email to David Owen about the hazardous waste question.  I will let you know what he says.  However, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we want to make any warranties about potential hazardous waste sources on the property.  At the most, we could make a warranty about the fact, if true, that we have never used the property in such a manner.  David Owen should be able to tell us a little more about the uses of the property.  

As far as Item #3 below is concerned, do you know if we have done a title search on the property?  If we need to do a title search, there is a guy in Louisiana that can do it for us.  If we know there is a discrepancy in the chain of title, is there a way to nullify the latest transfer between LRPC to LRCI.  

Let me know what you think.  If you think it is necessary to meet to discuss these points, please let me know.  

Thanks,

Rakhi

Did you hear anything from Keith Daigle regarding the title search?  In his last email, he indicated that it would be completed last Wednesday.  Has Kyle Purvis gotten back to you regarding the hazardous waste sources issue?  Hopefully, we can finalize these documents soon.  The guys from Assumption Parish are very anxious to get this deal closed quickly.

FYI...regarding the Sorrento ROWs with Enterprise Products, the money should be transferred this morning and the documents fully executed by this afternoon.  

Talk to you soon,

Rakhi

There is a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, Sept 25 at 9 am to discuss, among other things, the hazardous waste issues at Assumption Parish with Kyle Purvis and David Owen.  Would you be able to make to the meeting for about 10-15 minutes to discuss this issue?

I just spoke with Tina Horn from the Cameron Parish.  They received the letter voiding the original agreement.  She said that since using it for potable water was the only use they had in mind, they won't be needing the ROA to the pipeline.  (Actually, she told me that their engineer had told them that it would be possible to clean the pipeline to the point that it could be used for potable water.)

In light of this, could you please look into the procedures for abandoning the pipeline according to Louisiana law?

The contact information for Assumption Parish is as follows:

P.O. Box 524
Napoleonville, LA 70390

I have two changes that you may have already taken note of.  The first change is in the description of the property on the first page.  In the 8th line in the description, it says ""the South property line a distance or 260.02...""  it should read ""distance of 260.02"".  This change also needs to be made in the description contained within Exhibit B.  In the description contained within Exhibit B, there should not be a period after the words ""to the point of beginning"" in the 10th line.  

The second change is also in Exhibit B on page 2.   In the paragraph that starts ""all parties signing the written instrument...."", I don't think ""marital status"" should be in there.   

One final thing, the purchase price for the warehouse and land is $100,000.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.  Also, let me know if you need any help with the lawn-mowing agreement.   

Thanks for your help.

The name of the guy in Lafayette, LA who can do a title search for us if we need him to is Art LeBlanc, (337) 233-9099.  However you would like to handle it is fine with me. 

Like I mentioned on the phone, Roger Westbrook is the one helping with the ROWs that Bridgeline is requesting on the Crawfish land.  He indicated some time back that he had received some of the drawings from Bridgeline.  If needed, I can set up a meeting with Roger once we know the status of the documents.  

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help on either of these.

Thanks,

		 Subject: KN Marketing and Onoek

Brant
Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.


1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok 
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing 
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are 
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently 
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a 
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its 
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When 
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all 
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master 
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the 
Enron Guaranty be for?


Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this.  
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.

Carol"
carol.clair@enron.com,"

Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 
from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. (""Guarantor"") for the benefit of 
Enron North America Corp. (""Enron"").  By letter addressed to you dated April 
6, 2000 (the ""Termination Letter""), Guarantor terminated its obligations 
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such 
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty 
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the 
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 
6 to read as follows:  ""This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date 
being the ""Termination Date"") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) 
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as 
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written 
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such 
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as 
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by 
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such 
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect 
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the 
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the 
terms of this Guaranty.""

1. Are there any ""credit terms"" that need to be disclosed at this point?  
Should it be made subject to credit terms?  Should we mention that these 
swaps will be documented under an ISDA Master Agreement with schedules to be 
negotiated or will the swps be done under the existing Master Agreement that 
we have with Olympic?

2. In Section A, I am not familiar with the ""EnronOnline 1-2 month bid price,

the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master 
and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken 
with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also 
have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

Carol, I spend 3.5 hours in the dental chair this morning and have a sore 
mouth, as well as cramps.  It's not one of my better days.  I also found out 
I have to have a root canal, 8 crowns, a fortune will be spent.  Anyway, she 
said the crown stuff would take 4 hours, which means 6-8, so I was wondering 
if you thought it better for me to take off when you guys weren't around.  
The week of July 17th, you'll be gone, Mary will be on vacation and Dan will 
be on vacation.  Would that be a good time for me to be gone too since it'll 
be quiet.  I have a lot of decay and need to get this over and done with 
soon.  After that's done, I should be finished except for routine cleanings.  
She's already done both side of my mouth.  Now, it's the front that has to be 
done.  I wanted to get your input before I started scheduling appointments 
where I'll have to be out an entire day.  

The Astros won last night and we were there!!!  We brought them luck!!!!!!

We plan to meet with these guys directly and through NIC (they have strong relationship with Tohoku) in the very near future to talk about other coal based derivatives and structures (Sydney is involved).  This effort was already underway before this announcement.  I met the President of Tohoku about two weeks ago and indicated possible opportunities.  We are trying to repair relationships here as EPower's major (and premature) announcements at the beginning of the year pissed them off to no end.

I had wanted to speak with you about this last week, but the time did not allow.  We currently have less than 5 spaces left on the trading floor.  The total build out costs would be just under USD800k (@ JPY120).  Getting the buildout in motion would allow this to be completed by beginning to mid December.  I don't mean to rush, but if ok, I'd like to give go ahead this week.

Any reason why you think John still has some responsibility here? Also have found that EPower is now under Hughes (EGS), but Nick stills reports to John.  It would seem that John's plan is to maintain a (cheap) option to come back in when the time is ready.

Don't know if you have seen this, but believe it would be worthwhile to provide something like this to EGM.  This is certainly more info than is being made available via daily voice mails from OOC.

I have attached a presentation that outlines our current analysis concerning TOCOM and the other markets in Japan.  This presentation should be looked at as linked to the presentation concerning Nissho Iwai sent out last Wednesday.  I would suggest that you look at the other presentation first.  NIC helps provide us with the local market insight that would take real time for us to develop on our own.  I believe that the local trading markets are interesting and worth Enron moving forward with.  What you will see as you look at these presentations is in fact a call for an overall Asian strategy for EGM.  I think that this office and the outlines provided can form the seed and the way forward to accomplish this.

I look forward to going through the details of this presentation.

We have been working to try and get the crude products available in yen, but have not had much luck after Darren left.  You can see the general summary of the situation below.  We'd like to get the product up and believe that with some basic publicity it could be quite successful.  Any ideas on how to overcome these points?

Any insight?  I'll bring this up with Nowlan tomorrow.  We have companies looking for LPG swaps and while we appreciate recent volatility, when can we move forward?

Incidently, we lost out on a WTI swap with Mitsui OSK the other day when another trader called them (at midnight) to close the trade on the recent dip.

An indication of real cooperation between EJ and Enron Coal.  We received the signed engagement letter from NIC yesterday to proceed with this transaction.  Also good for our coal guys to see that NIC is delivering us deals and value.  Enron Coal to take offtake, EJ arranging financing, structuring and insurance.

I am trying to project the next month with NIC (and announcements, etc) and want to determine what would provide the greatest impact for us.  We will be discussing the budget tomorrow and I'd like to also determine when we can review our draft MOU with you and Mike.  We plan to show this to NIC by Thursday of this week.  Still plan on being over the week after next.

Joe

trading:  I'd like to set up a time to speak with you about this.  I also interviewed Brad McKay and Gregg Cooper.  I have asked HR to make sure that these guys come and speak with you as well (this week).



 "
joseph.hirl@enron.com,"

The following attached documents are the draft MOU (still rough) and a summary of the document.  We have not yet showed either of these to Sato, but would plan to do so early next week.  We met with Freshfields for 2 hours the other day to get some basic thoughts and to gauge their interest in helping to draft the JV agreement.  They thought our MOU could be more simple and while I don't completely disagree, I'd like to make sure Sato is 90-95% there before we bring their senior guy(s) to Houston.  Regardless, we need to run both of you through where we are today and plans for the next couple of weeks.  I have a meeting and dinner with Nakatani (head of corp planning and guy who would sign MOU tomorrow).  From all indications it looks as though things are still on track.  There still are a number of items still to work out, but some of these might be deliberately left blank in the MOU.

Jeff:  I had traded voice mails with Mike about (among other things) having a conference call at 5:30 pm your Thurs (0730 Friday Tokyo).  I am not sure if this is confirmed, but pls let us know if this works or an alternative time.

Subject: Topics for General Counsel Off-site

Jim, the following is in response to your request that we forward to you our 
suggested topics for the General Counsel offsite on April 4&5. 
 1. Outside Counsel
      - Who are the top firms we are using?
      -Should there be a data base for firms we are using(and particular 
attorneys in the firm)and for what.
      -Could/should the data base include info on fees paid to firms in the 
previous year so we know who the top firms are and also so we have an idea 
how much we pay in legal fees on an Enron wide basis.
     -What position do we take on probable fee increases toi cover the 
tremendous salary increases that firms recently gave to their associates?

 2.Legal Web Page
 Should we develop a Legal Group web page that has some of the info mentioned 
immediately above. We could also use this to pass on info re vacancies, 
announcements of new hires. This could also have a short bio on each attorney 
including in particular any particular expertise that the attorney may have 
so if someone has a question on swaps or Hart Scott or DOT regulations you 
could look inhouse first for answers to questions rather than picking up the 
phone and calling outside counsel for the answer to simple questions.

 3.Summer Clerks
 Should we have a centralized program for summer clerks?
 
 4. Recruiting
 Should we try to somewhat centralize this process or at a minimum set up a 
mechanism for letting the various groups know of good candidates that have 
been interviewed but not hired because of too many strong candidates for 1 
position.

 5. Management Succession
 I think we should develop a process for identifying/evaluating individuals 
who currently possess( or with some specific development could possess) the 
capability of moving into the ""management "" ranks of the legal function Enron 
wide. Thus when a vacancy does occur we have an idea of who are the persons 
who merit consideration from across the corporation to help ensure we are 
getting the best person for the job.

 6. One Enron- since the corporate theme is ""one Enron"" what can or should we 
be doing to make sure that happens.

Lauren and Kelly:

I attach the consolidated legal comments to the  proposed Security and
Human Rights Principles, as well as  copies of your overview memo and of
the Principles themselves.

In summary, the note says we see no major issue legal that cause us to
advise Enron not to endorse the Principles, but that we do see a number of
significant matters that Enron should consider before it makes a decision
to endorse them.

There are two other items in addition to those mentioned in the note:

   In regards to e-mails we exchanged yesterday regarding the fact that
   these Principles are targeted at the extractive industry peer group that
   Enron tries to distinguish itself from and is largely exiting, I
   understand that Vicki will be contacting Kelly to discuss your
   suggestions  on differentiating Enron from those industries.
   It is not clear whether the decision to endorse the Principles must be
   made by the full Enron board or some level short of the Enron board.  I
   think Vicki will be discussing that with Rob.

Please call if you have any questions.

		 Subject: EECC Litigation Update - Puerto Rico, Marmara, Dabhol


I would like to update the legal report I just sent to you as follows:

   Puerto Rico:  Larry Izzo had a conference call with Misson Energy
   regarding the claims between EECC and EcoElectrica. Enron's shareholder
   representative was also involved.  The parties reached agreement in
   principle on the open issues (the owner dropped its claims against EECC,
   EECC relinquished two smaller claims, the Owner will pay EECC's
   remaining claims).  Bracewell's analysis of the claims was very helpful
   in reaching this result.
   Marmara: As expected, Black&Veatch has filed a formal notice of
   arbitration against EECC relative to sums they claim are due them with
   respect to the Marmara Project. EECC management expects that this will
   be settled early next year, and that it may provide an opportunity to
   reach a global settlement with Black & Veatch re Puerto Rico and
   potential future work.  Gail Brownfeld and Scott Burdine of Hagans, Bob,
   Burdine are both up to speed.
   Dabhol: Besix has informed us that we will be receiving thier notice of
   arbitration re the Dabhol Quarry before the end of the year. We are told
   that they have changed their counsel, apparently releasing the English
   firm of Masons and engaging a firm in Washington DC of Watts, Tieder,
   Hoffer & Fitzgerald to carry the claim forward. This is an unusual move,
   since the contract is governed by English law and the site of the
   arbitration will London. Besix's local representative told  our project
   manager that Besix was not happy with the Masons advice, but it may be
   that they want a US firm involved, backed up by an English firm. I have
   asked Phil Bruns to check into the reputation of  Watts, Teider. He was
   not familiar with them, but has found that it is a 67 lawyer firm that
   specializes in construction and real with a main office in northern
   Virginia and offices in California. Gail Brownfeld, Phil Bruns, and
   Jonathon Rosshandler are all aware of this development.

Subject: RE: SAN ANTONIO MEETING


A few thoughts on topics that might be worthy of discussion at our meeting: -

1. Outside Counsel fees;
2. Recruitment and retention of lawyers and the impact of recent increases in 
salaries elsewhere;
3. Cross calibration of recruits and promotions within the legal department;
4. Communication between the various groups;
5. Are we facing an increased risk of investigation worldwide e.g. FCPA, 
other regualtory issues and are we doing enough to deal with these risks?
6. Technology - as the company becomes more and more e-commerce and 
technologically advanced, is the legal department keeping up e.g. should 
lawyers be more  computer literate, do we need to send them on courses etc?

These are just a few thoughts and please do not hesitate to contact me if you 
would like to discuss any of them or would like some additional ideas.

Thanks very much

Subject: Insurance coverage Cuiaba  

Rob,

 Had discussion with Dick Vincent this afternoon related to construction 
insurance coverage of GasMat, and explained him the plan for the two 
remaining ridges and the further delay on the gas at the plant date. He 
confirmed that we're covered on the EPE and GOB construction insurance but 
that coverage for GOM needs to be extended. 
Told him that you will be reviewing the insurance coverage of the project 
with focus on the political risk insurance and to copy you on communication 
on the subject.

Regards,

Christiaan

I'm sorry we missed you at the Christmas Party.  My wife and daughter had 
tickets to a Christmas Play that conflicted, otherwise it would have been 
nice to see everyone.  Things are fine with me, though big changes are in 
store.  I'm really worried about Peter and Brian because they have not heard 
anything yet from anyone about what their role will be.  I should have more 
to say about my situation by tomorrow afternoon.

Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer will pay.


Now we just need to come up with a fix for the drop dead date.

Rob,

Didn't he say we were only covered up to $200 MM (e.g. the limit of our 
contract frustration cover?) With the current Shell/enron sharing 
percentages, it would seem that we are entitled to 72% of the $360 MM payment 
or $259 MM, thus we would only be out by $59 MM.

According to Cliff Shedd, we would be covered by insurance if we terminated 
the contract with Furnas and Furnas failed to pay the termination payment.  
However the insurers will only pay after we receive an arbitration judgement 
against them and the refuse to honor the judgement.  I assume we would also 
have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras).

Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material 
default.

Rob,

Happy New Year!

How have you been doing? Last time when I talked to Blanca after the latest 
reorg, she said that it hadn't been announced how Southern Cone was going to 
be. How's it going now?

After nearly 3 years with Enron, I plan to go back to B school. I want to 
apply for Rice Executive MBA because this will be the most efficient way for 
me. Besides, I plan to apply two other full-time MBA programs. You have been 
my supervisor for one year. Although that was my first year with Enron, that 
assignment was quite important to me. I've learned a lot through that year 
and later I realize more and more the creativeness and greatness of the Debt 
Fund. The year with Debt Fund was an important phase of my professional 
history. May I ask you to be one of my evaluators? As you know, the 
competition for B school is always hard. A strong recommendation from you, a 
person in senior management will be crucial for my application. The deadline 
for Rice is Jan. 15. I'm sorry to give you such a short time. With the other 
two, I plan to finish them by the end of January or early Feburary. I 
appreciate it very much if you could spare me some time.

Thank you in advance for your generous help.


Regards,

Maggie

 Do you put together a spreadsheet calculating the price for gas purchases

For 08/00 production, there is a $.56 difference from what is in Sitara and

Location - at a fire station in a Hispanic Community - exact location will be 
forwarded shortly but estimated distance from ENE office = less than 15 min.

Expect News Conference to last a total of 30 minutes, including Q&A. Jeff 
Skilling will be spokesperson for Selection Committee. However, we will try 
to have as many committee members present as possible. 

Mayor will likely discuss (estimated time = 10 min.):
 - changes that are required at HFD - potential need to bring in an outsider, 
etc...
 - reasoning behind involvement of Enron/Jeff Skilling & formation of 
selection committee - de-politicize the process, etc...

JS should speak about the following (estimated time = 10-15 min.):
 - how he became involved in the process
 - how the committee members were selected
 - who the members are with a brief background on each (We plan to provide a 
bio on each of the committee members as part of the press release)
 - time line for Fire Chief selection 

Q&A (estimated time = 5-10 min.)
 - expect questions along the lines of: Are the meetings going to be open or 
closed?, Outsider vs. Insider related questions...

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/issues with the above. 
I'll coordinate collection of Bios from Committee members. Anything else I 
can do to help out here?

"" Heart scare sends Bob Lanier to hospital""

Summary:
Lanier's defibrillator went off
wife called 911
first responder fire engine at the scene in 6 min
SUV arrived 2 min later, or within 8 min of call
""estimated"" arrival time of an ambulance, 2 min later, or within 10 min of 
call - both of the City's downtown ambulances were at hospitals on other calls
Mayor Brown gave the okay to transport Lanier to hospital in SUV

Implications:
Not enough ambulances downtown and Mayor has plans to close both downtown 
fire stations with a temporary station to cover the downtown area until new 
station built (3-5 years)
purpose of SUVs is to free paramedics from transporting patients to hospital 
so can respond to EMS calls more quickly (not to mention that SUVs are not 
equipped to transport a patient)

Troy said questions are OK.  Here are three suggestions from Troy:

1. Please explain briefly the type of government (i.e. City Manager,
Mayor, Council, Fire Commissioner) or other system that you had served
with as a fire officer in the past 10 years.

2. State whether the fire department has any employee group, association
or union that is recognized as the bargaining agent for the department.
If so, please describe your working relationship with that organization.

3. Does the department where you presently work have any type of state or
local civil service?  If so, explain.

  Diana has asked that we let her know whenever we have variances, disputes, or make changes to any deals concerning these two counterparties Tacoma and Seattle City Light from today forward.  

  I suggest that we querry weekly for these 2 counterparties in DMS and provide Diana with a PMA report from DMS so that she can read any Settlements and VM comments in DMS about the deal and ask questions accordingly.

  Thanks,

  Virginia


  "
virginia.thompson@enron.com,"

Here are a couple of things I've thought of that will make it easier for me to research deals when there is a dispute.  Please discuss whatever necessary with the traders to help me improve the speed and accuracy of my research. 

1.) All notebooks need to have clear and accurate dates in them.  Notebooks with no dates at all or random dates are useless for me without the traders' interpretation.

2.) Can we have the traders leave their notebooks here at all times?  I often find notebooks and logs missing for whatever reason.  

3.) One thing that is getting better is the accuracy of the Inc sheets, however, I still sometimes find that the trader's notes and the Inc sheets or the El Paso Model don't match.  At that point, I don't know which one to go by.  I need to be sure that I can trust the accuracy of the Inc sheets as the end-all.

4.) Please make sure that all real-time deals or real-time extended deals are getting routed.  I've come across a number of deals that are not routed and this makes it hard for me to know if my research is accurate.  It also makes it hard for me to change the other side of a deal that requires changes.

5.) Please make sure that all deals get recorded and scheduled.  I've seen a few deals that are in the traders' notebooks, but that haven't been entered in EnPower.  You know the result.

6.) CUTS (need I say more) ...are a mess.  I really really need to see notes on every cut!!!!!  This means notes on the cut sheets or in the lotus notes database AND notes in deal scheduling ! 
When a schedule is cut and the trader has been informed of the cut, I need to see this cut made in deal scheduling with a note.  Many of my DMS's could have been avoided if the trader had made the cut in EnPower (this means I found a note regarding the cut but no further action had been taken to record this in EnPower).  I specifically need to see the following for every cut schedule:  Where did resupply come from (deal # too)?  Was it a bookout (deal # too)?  What's the resupply price?  Who at the counterparty did our trader talk to?  What is the reason for the cut?  And please initial your notes so that if I have a question about them, I know who to ask.
You can never make too many notes!!

One thing to remember is that Deal Entry, Deal Scheduling, and Lotus Notes do not communicate with each other, so though it is a grueling task, every transaction and all notes have to be entered in at least 2 places.  (it's called copy and paste)

If we can keep these things in mind, I think we will have fewer disputes in the future.  And when we do have disputes, I'll be able to figure them out in a more timely manner.  

Thanks for your attention to these things.  I look forward to bugging you less in the future.

 I spoke with Don at Public Service Company of New Mexico again today regarding the Schedule 9 Loss Compensation Service charges.  He re-confirmed that the market price that is part of the Schedule 9 equation (Loss Compensation Service = # MW wheeled x market price x 3%) is a market price that he obtains from his marketers.  I re-confirmed that his 'marketers' are his traders, though I do not know whether these are Long Term, Cash, or Real-Time Traders.

 He is going to talk to his traders to find out where this price came from.  I brought up the point that there has been a price cap of $91.87 in the west and asked that he bring that point forward in his discussions.  

 He should respond to me on Monday 8-20-01, on which day the bill is due.

 I will keep you posted on my findings.

Just a heads-up that I sent this to Bill,  so he may be asking you what the 
problems have been with EES.
Could I bring by the discrepancies a bit later?

Thanks for your response.  It appears that we sent EES the wrong prices in 
the spreadsheet that we sent to them.  Bill said he would make the changes, 
so I won't bring this over to you (not yet anyway).   I also told Mark in 
Houston what is happening, so this will hopefully be done.

Thanks for your help.

To: Virginia Thompson/PDX/ECT@ECT

Subject: Re: EES Changes for March  

Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by 
your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. 
At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we 
had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had 
been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI 
buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for 
the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price 
average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of 
their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we 
sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out 
right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions 
regarding that time frame.

Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some 
discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but 
didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over 
there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to 
resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions.

Dear Traders:

  Please be advised that the following worksheet is an estimated summary of transmission ancillary charges.  These charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them.  To figure approximately how much each MW of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied, use the following worksheet, adding each of the 4 ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost.

  For example:  

   I reserve 55 MW's of Sierra Pacific transmission.
 
  Scheduling Fees:   			(55 MW's x 0.1649) =   9.07
  Reactive Supply and Voltage fees: 	9.1692 x (0.45 x 55) x 0.0234 = 5.31
  Line Losses:				0.0234 x 55 MW's x (anticipate average energy cost so far this month; circa $45) = 57.92
				**Please note that if energy prices are higher, this line loss charge will be higher too;  ie - if prices are at $300, this charge will be 386.10**
 
   TOTAL ANCILLARY:			$ 72.30 for 55 MW's  = $ 1.315 per MW hour of transmission


   

Attached is the worksheet:

                             
Please ask me if you have any questions.

We are having the same problem with Montana Power's checkout as we had last month: the volume of disputes is overwhelming!!

I have looked at the Inc sheets and found that EnPower matches the Inc. sheets.
But in fairness to MPC's disputes, last month when I trusted the Inc sheets, and I pulled the tapes, I found that our Inc. sheets were wrong in a number of places.

Mike and I are doing the March 2001 checkout and are having trouble finding your logs, your notebooks, or any information regarding the dates in question.

I am listing below the dates and HE that we are having disputes for.  Please look at your logs and let me know the MW value, price, and who you spoke to at MPC at what time.  Please do not give me what the Inc sheets say, as Mike and I have already looked at them.

I expect an answer from each of you ASAP.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.





Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury."

After that, it looks like we would play the aggies this weekend or next.

It is uncertain if AC will be party these games."
michael.simmons@enron.com,"

I'm very disappointed with the way this whole situation has been mishandled.  
I can't speak as to what occurred on the Anderson side, but these are my 
thoughts on this situation.

1.  All the Enron captains (including the Aggies) agreed to play Saturday 
regardless of the weather.  I confirmed that we would be on as rain and cold 
weather were very likely to occur.  Had the other captains decided to not 
play in the cold rain, we could have rescheduled the game for  Sunday or an 
alternative day.

2.  My understanding is that the Aggies called the game  (Billy Lemmons and 
Ted Bland) and then changed the awarding of the tickets in way that directly 
benefitted the Aggie teams.   Correct me if I'm wrong, but neither Billy nor 
Ted were out at the field to judge the weather conditions prior to calling 
off the game.  Nor were the captains contacted for their input.   The rules 
have been abitrarily changed in mid-stream to the advantage of the Aggies and 
this is grossly unfair.   The top 2 fund raisers for the Enron Aggie teams 
were to be awarded footballs that were autograped by the Aggie football 
team.   Given this additional  incentive, it's not surprising that they 
raised more money than the UT teams  (by my unofficial estimates).  By one 
estimate who was familiar with the aggie fund rainsing efforts, one team 
raised about $2,000 and the other raised about $5,000. 

So what do we do about this situation?   It's up to you to decide if you want 
to play  in the rescheduled tournament.  Personally, I don't see much point 
nor motivation to play.  It surely won't be for bragging rights, as the real 
UT/a&m game will have already occurred.  In addition, I think it would be 
appropriate to give the people who donated funds the option to get their 
money back.   The situation that now exists is not what I raised money for.  

I want to thank you all for the work and effort you put forth for this event, 
it's unfortunate that it wasn't handled better.

I will be out all of next week.  Leave me a voicemail if you need to speak 
to  me.   I will have your shirts on the Monday following Thanksgiving."

Dress accordingly to stay warm and dry.       I would recommend that you buy 
a cheap plastic poncho, preferrably see-through (at walmart for $2 or less).
Be prepared for whatever the weather has to offer..

Bring your cleats  (no metal cleats) for traction.   If you need cleats,  
Oshman's has good Riddell football shoes for $20 to $35.

Finally, today is the last day to get donations...   so  get  'em..

How's our running plays?   Are we prepared for mud bowl 2000?"

Goal Line Isolation




DESCRIPTION

Line up in a Trips Right formation.  Have inside receiver run a five 
yardpost, drawing coverage from the middle zone defender.  The middle 
receiver will run an eight yard curl.  The outside receiver will run a 
delayed slant.  Most of the coverage should be moving left.  The running back 
will delay, then run up the middle to the back of the end zone, then dart to 
the right, the QB will delay and sprint right also. The defense will be 
moving left and should be a step behind.  If the QB can sprint to the end 
zone, a lane may be open, or else the RB should be open. 

QB : The quarterback should initally delay for a split second before 
sprinting to his right. quarterback can make a good head fake to the left or 
look at his receivers on the left before . He should run the ball into the 
end zone if it is open or throw the ball to his running . The quarterback 
should run the ball if the defense is out of , even if the running back is 
open. This will eliminate the chance of a incomplete pass or .

RB : The running back should initially delay for a split second to give a 
block for the quarterback. This will allow the play to develop and keep the 
defense from worrying about the RB. The RB then runs forward to the back of 
the end zone and makes a sharp cut to the right before going out of bounds. 
Make sure the running back stays around the back of the end zone so the 
quarterback can throw the ball over the defenders head if need be.

Other Players : The other players should do their best to draw the defense 
towards the left side of the field.

==================================

Center Hook and Ladder


DESCRIPTION

Line up with twins to the left; one blocker on the left of center; one WR on 
the right and a RB to the left of QB

RB: go in short motion to the left; make a loop patern on outside of the 
""twins"" who should block for him. The RB is secondary receiver.

Right WR: Do a 5-yard button hook to inside.

QB: Throw to right WR.

Right WR: Lateral ball to the center who after the snap should be moving 
parallel to line of scrimmage, about 2-3 yards down field.

Center: Receive lateral and run option with QB who should stay in 
pitch-relationship after he throws the ball.

QB: If the hook isn't open, hit the RB or run for it.

Left Guard: Block 


QB : The quarterback needs to first read the defense. If the right receiver 
can beat the coverage then look the defenders off and deliver a good quick 
pass to the receiver. The receiver should be able to use his body to shield 
the defender. If the defense is in good position to stop the pass call an 
audible or be prepared to throw the ball to your secondary receiver (RB). As 
soon as the quarterback throws the ball he needs to immediately get into 
position to receive the pitch from his center. The quarterback will most 
likely have to be running full speed right after he throws the ball so he can 
be in a good pitch relation with his center. Make sure the quarterback never 
stops running with the center.

Right WR: The right receiver needs to run full speed off the line of 
scrimmage to push his defender back. As soon as he gets about 5-yards down 
the field he should curl in towards the quarterback and use his body to 
shield the defender. Make sure the receiver knows to knock the ball down if 
the quarterback makes a bad pass. As soon as the receiver catches the ball he 
should immediately pitch the ball to his center. Don't be in too big of a 
hurry. If the pitch isn't there the receiver should turn the ball up field 
for as many yards as possible or try to get the pitch to his quarterback. 
Don't pitch the ball to the other team. 

Center: The center will run 2-3 yards forward then drag the line of scrimmage 
left to right. The center should be running at a medium speed until the 
receiver catches the ball. This will allow the receiver to get a good handle 
on the ball before pitching it. The center should be on the inside of the 
receiver and must be prepared to give a quick pitch to the quarterback. If 
there is a defender between the center and the quarterback, the center should 
fake the pitch and continue up field.

Other Players : The other players need to follow the routes on the play 
diagram so they force the defenders to the opposite side of the field. The RB 
should always be ready for the pass. He is the secondary receiver and needs 
to be able to bail the quarterback out of trouble.

Caution : This play requires practice and flawless execution. Timing is 
Crucial.

We would like to have a scrimmage/practice with your team this Wednesday.    
The aggie teams have already held practice as of Sunday and are scrimmaging 
this Wednesday as well  (to which we are not invited).   As they pose the 
greatest hurdle to obtaining the tickets, it is essential that we prepare in 
similar fashion.....

However, we are unable to find a LIGHTED field to practice upon (Memorial is 
unlit)..     


If anyone knows of a lighted field for practice  (Rice University???), please 
contact me ASAP so we can schedule a practice for Wednesday evening.

Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.





Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.




"
michael.simmons@enron.com,"

It's important that everyone make this practice.     We are still trying to 
find a lit field, if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.

 Wed. Practice

7 pm

Location:  TBD... or Memorial Park...."

The team to date is as follows:

Stephen 
Eric
Luis
Paul
Sarah   
Myself
Christopher Chenoweth - new addition (recruited away from Webb Jennings' team 
at no small cost)

One other unnamed guy (Luis, I need this name).

To do:

1.   I need all of you to confirm (by voice or email) that you will be able 
to play on Saturday.  If I don't hear from you, I will have to replace you.  
If you think there is a chance that you won't make, please contact me ASAP.

2.   We need to deliver $2,000 in donations.  If you haven't started bringing 
in donations, please do so immediately.  I have the donation envelopes, 
contact me and I'll have one sent to you.

3.  We will have a scrimmage this Wed. or Thurs.  so mark your calender.  I 
encourage you all to take whatever steps necessary to see to your physical 
preparation for this game.

 extra pts.   1  from 3 yd line,,  2pts from 10 yrd line

Games are 2, 20 minute halves with a 7 play rule at the end of the 20 
minutes... 7 plays occur after the 20 minutes...


the Enron teams play first at  10 am  and then we have a 1 hour break...

the AC teams play at 11 and then play again at 12 against us..

so the AC teams will be tired.   

The next game follows at 1 pm, the game against the Enron aggies (most 
likely) for the tickets.

===

As soon as we get into the lead on the first game and cover whatever bets we 
make with Webb  (a 17 pt lead in the first half ends the game)..   the top 
players should take a break  (eric, paul, and stephen, alternatively should 
take a break on offense, and Luis should sit  out on defense)

This is especially important for the game against AC, which should be an 
easier game.   As soon as we get a 1 to 2 touchdown lead, the top players 
should rest.

Last year our team was pretty tired going into the final game and with good 
time management we can lower our chances of key injuries and tired players..

==

Eric if you have time,  throw some more plays together... perhaps some more 
option,  pick off pass routes, reverses,  pitches to a back who passes to the 
QB, etc...  indicate what the line/center should do for these run plays...

finally, Saturday morning lets take 5-10 minutes to go over defensive 
assignments and go over how zone works... and who is responsible for what.. 
so that we're all on the same page."
michael.simmons@enron.com,"

Ex.   outs, curls, out-and-up, post..  etc...     


also,,    You give routes to the linemen and they should block  and then roll 
out into the open flats once the defense goes past.... 

AND... most importantly.. how did you  draw those plays  excel....

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the Enron Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

-Mike  ext 37842



Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think 
this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday is as good as any.  If not this 
weekend, you will need to organize this as I will be on vacation for the next 
two weeks.

Attached is the revised 4th Qtr Forecast Summary.

Also, attached is the expense analysis I did.  Please note, I did not include UAF.

I have compared our actual numbers with James' spreadsheet and Steve Kleb's earnings model.  Once I made that adjustment for the $244 reserve in August on James' spreadsheet, we are all in agreement that the YTD actuals for TW commercial is $162.7.  I have also verified that number with Robert Miller and he agrees that is the number reflected on the Income Statement.

The $244 reserve reversal was made in September and reflected in the transport margins revenues.

Here are the answers to questions 1, 2, & 4:

1.  What percent of TW's volumes transported during the 3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001 was firm
     vs. interruptible?


		   	       	            2000 			            2001
  				July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
IT Percentage			.09	.09	.09	 	.10	.08	.07
Firm Percentage		.91	.91	.91		.90	.92	.93


2.  What percent of TW's pipe capacity was used during  3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001? 
 
		   			2000 			            2001
West flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.90	.95	.97 	 	 100	 100	 .91


		   			2000 			            2001
East flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.81	.85	.86	 	 100	 100	 .91

4.    On James Weitekamp's ""ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights"" schedule, transport 
      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001.  This doesn't 
      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not.  Why does this difference
      exist?
 
     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing 
     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increased from East to East because 
     pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter.

I talked to Chris last week during a recruiting event that Analyst and Associate pool hosted at Rice.
He was very interested in the kinds of projects that our group is working on.  Also, he has had an 
extensive experience in the Energy industry.
I am attaching his resume.  He has one more year left in school, but If you are interested, I could 
invite him over to talk to our group members, and get a better feel for the Enron Research environment.

Vince, 

I hope all is well with you considering ...

Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM.  She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached a link to the hospital's webite that has her picture (she is much cuter in person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chicago Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.

For the record, I have read Judge Biren's ruling, and contrary to what people 
might have said in the conference call on Friday, it is silent on the topics 
of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments.  The 
three-sentence e-mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the 
PHC at which time she will rule on the motion, and states that she might 
issue a further ruling prior to the PHC.  I think it is probably fair to 
expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at 
the PHC.

Subject: SoCal GIR settlement telecon

I participated in a teleconference today at 3:00 p.m. with several members of 
the ""all-party"" settlement group.  The ALJ assigned to the GIR case, Andrea 
Biren, has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal's Motion to Extend the 
deadline for filing the all-party settlement.   Although I personally haven't 
seen the document yet, it was the primary focus of the meeting.

According to accounts from the group, Judge Biren's ruling did not grant 
SoCal's motion for extension.  Rather, she will hear arguments on the motion 
during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday, April 11.  Judge 
Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full 
scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer 
any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the 
Commission.  Unfortunately, she is silent on what date the testimony would be 
due (originally, testimony was due on April 17).  In addition, Judge Biren's 
ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into 
something different during Tuesday's prehearing conference (ie. a different 
procedural schedule, or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol).

The telecon group decided to do the following: (1) approach CPUC commissioner 
Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all-party settlement and 
ask him to intervene in favor of the extension, (2) go before Judge Biren on 
Tuesday (as a group, and individually, if necessary) and request that in leiu 
of a full scale testimony procedure, would she accept a process whereby, 
similar to what was done in the PG&E settlement, parties file declarations in 
favor of one settlement versus another, and then the Judge 
supervises/conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the 
settlement?  If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process, one 
which arguably doesn't offer as complete a record in the case (which most on 
the call felt was the likely outcome), then would she agree to a schedule 
whereby she grants the SoCal motion, the all-party settlement is filed on 
April 17, then all parties, including the Norm Pedersen group, would have the 
chance to file testimony (only testimony, not additional declarations) 
indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons/logic, 
including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives, on or before 
May 5?

As far as the all-party settlement document is concerned, SoCal will be 
forwarding a preliminary (as yet incomplete) draft for the parties to review, 
but not to comment on.  SoCal intends to circulate another, more complete 
version Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments/changes.  

As far as Transwestern is concerned, I've spoken independently with the team 
 Susan, Mark and Jeff Dasovich.  Each of us will review and provide TW 
comments to SoCal regarding the settlement document.  Susan will be 
representing TW at the Prehearing Conference on Tuesday.  Mark Baldwin will 
be there also to support Susan's efforts on Tuesday.  Susan and Jeff (and 
maybe Mark?) will try and hook-up Tuesday morning to compare notes and talk 
about the upcoming Commission PHC.

Steve, between Susan and I, we'll continue to forward documentation and other 
materials regarding this case as well as to provide you with our comments 
and/or any drafts of testimony TW intends to file in this case.

Subject: Pedersen inquiry

Hey gang,
I've taken the first stab at answering Norm's inquiry... give me your 
thoughts.  Also, Susan, what is the protocol for a case being litigated at 
the CPUC for inquiries like this?  Should we put a disclaimer that the 
information we might provide is protected under Rule 51 or other ""settlement 
discussions only"" protection?



Mr. Pedersen,
First, I'd like to clear-up the nomenclature being used here.  As you know, 
currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any 
interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for 
intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the 
CPUC proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the 
historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern 
deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.  
The 340 MMcf/d difference between the mainline capacity and the physical 
capacity into SoCalGas at North Needles is used to provide firm service at 
our other delivery points at or near the California border, including PG&E, 
Mojave, Southwest Gas, Citizens Utilities, and in the near future, directly 
connected electric generation plants.



"
jeff.dasovich@enron.com,"

They have been given authority by the PUC to begin taking steps to sell from the remaining two (Alsio and La Goleta), but the PUC left some issues (principally around ratemaking) open, and have not given them the authority to actually begin selling the gas.  SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  However, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at book valueunclear where the Commission will come out on that.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

identifying those locations, per the request of ALJ Biren.? We have confirmed 
wherever possible the incoming receipt point capacities with the pipelines 
and also tried to fairly characterize the take-away capacities and deliveries 
from those receipt points.? Please forward your comments to me as soon as

Some time back I distributed the final term sheet summarizing the settlement 
that a large number of interests reached with SoCalGas to unbundle SoCalGas' 
Transportation, Storage and Balancing assets and services.   Recently, many 
have asked questions about the status and substance of the settlement.  The 
Term Sheet summarizing the settlement is attached.

The California Commission has held hearings on the settlement and parties are 
now filing briefs.  The ALJ's proposed decision should be out in the next 
45-60 days or so and the Commission should be in a position to approve or 
reject the proposal in mid- to late fall.

Over thirty parties signed the settlement.  They represent everyone from 
small consumers, to pipelines, to marketers, to utilities.  Only 2-3 parties 
actively opposed it.  Unfortunately, California has a new governor, and his 
two recent appointments to the Commission have thus far been pretty 
unfriendly when it comes to competition.  Nonetheless, there's a significant 
effort underway on the part of a large number of parties to win Commission 
approval.  I'll keep you posted.

If you have any questions about either substance or status, don't hesitate to 
email or call at 415.782.7822.  Please forward along to others who might be 
interested.

Best,
Jeff

But knowing PG&E and how these things work, it ain't ever over till its

recognize, Jeff, it doesn't mean that someone else won't spell it out clearly

proposal and makes the Wheeler situation fit into that framework, rather than

Late breaking good news!  Attached find Rich Hall's testimony on behalf of 
PG&E.  It would appear that Mr. Baldwin's extensive lobbying efforts have 
paid off here.  Nowhere do I see a specific reference to Hector 
Road/Transwestern as another example of the Comprehensive Settlement's 
failure to deal with the allocation problem at Wheeler Ridge.  That being 
said, I note that the ""generic"" prescription sponsored by PG&E applies in all 
cases where, ""the combined capacity of the upstream interconnects exceeds the 
downstream take-away capacity.""   Anyone paying close attention, or anyone 
with an axe to grind here, will be quick to point out that there maybe other 
examples similar to Wheeler can you say, ""Hector Road?""

We'll just have to deal with questions on the application of the generic rule 
during the hearings.  I think it good news that PG&E chose not to spell it 
out for anyone.  Maybe we owe them one after all?  Thoughts?

Our messages are getting a little mixed.   So .. to that end, can we have a 
day or two to:  (1) figure out whether we want a reverse auction, competitive 
bidding for PLR, a GCIM-like mechanism? and (2) rationalize the various 
mechanisms if want it all.  

I'm confident that we can rationalize all of these mechanisme.g, we can 
limit the percentage of load put up for auction, etc. if we put our minds to 
it.  However, we haven't done so yet.  

We will discuss this tomorrow in SFO.

I agree that the briefest possible response is probably best.  In any event, 
let's wait until after we speak with Brian.  Also, I'm thinking that a 
written response might actually be better than calling him.  I've dealt with 
Norm's kind before and they are very creative about paraphrasing.

I think it provides dear Norm with too much information.  Susan's the boss,

Subject: Pedersen inquiry

Hey gang,
I've taken the first stab at answering Norm's inquiry... give me your 
thoughts.  Also, Susan, what is the protocol for a case being litigated at 
the CPUC for inquiries like this?  Should we put a disclaimer that the 
information we might provide is protected under Rule 51 or other ""settlement 
discussions only"" protection?



Mr. Pedersen,
First, I'd like to clear-up the nomenclature being used here.  As you know, 
currently SoCalGas doesn't assign ""primary rights"" to deliveries off of any 
interconnecting pipeline.  The establishment of tradeable rights for 
intrastate capacity is among the issues currently under consideration in the 
CPUC proceeding.   However, if what you are asking about is what has been the 
historical or otherwise available receipt capacity for Transwestern 
deliveries at North Needles, then let me offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.  
The 340 MMcf/d difference between the mainline capacity and the physical 
capacity into SoCalGas at North Needles is used to provide firm service at 
our other delivery points at or near the California border, including PG&E, 
Mojave, Southwest Gas, Citizens Utilities, and in the near future, directly 
connected electric generation plants.

I am not familiar with the deal, but if the path is something different than East of Thoreau to Calif, the fuel rate is above max which I would think would qualify is as a neg rate transaction.  I would suggest talking to Teb Lokey regarding the actual filing as his shop will be making this filing.

Transwestern must certify to BP by December 31, 2001 or such date as the parties may agree upon, that Transwestern has received acceptable licenses, permits (except air permits), approvals, right-of-way interests and utilities for construction and operation of the Red Rock Expansion.  If this condition is not met, or otherwise waived by the parties, BP shall have the right upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, exercised no later than sixty (60) days after December 31, 2001 to terminate the agreement.

Transwestern must certify to BP by March 31, 2002 that Transwestern has received acceptable air permits.

Subject: TW Cash for Fuel Issues

Christine,

After our meeting last week, John, Elizabeth, Gerry, Richard, Dave & I 
discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process. We had 
several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:

Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm 
contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel 
discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this 
special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process 
to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. 
This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at 
this time.

Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items 
that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we 
default these ""02"" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using 
our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to 
reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the 
volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes 
scheduled & paid for in cash..

Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that ""The shipper 
may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a 
receipt point on shipper's service agreement"" Does this only apply to the 
shipper's primary receipt points?

I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like 
we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please 
let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Subject: Re: TW's LFT changes  

Linda,
Sorry it took longer than I thought to get back with you. Marketing had 
several issues come up last week.

Here are the answers to your questions.

Item 1. Is this a contract waiver? I talked with Lorraine and here is what 
Marketing wants: They would like the request form to be at a shipper level 
(LE Level) that applies to all their new, current and future LFT contracts. 
Since it will be a manual process, can you keep an LFT waiver log/book that 
is at a LE level, then place a copy of this signed overrun request form in 
each LFT contract file & change the flag to Yes on each active LFT contract 
for that shipper?
Item 2. Can they change their mind on the waiver-if so would this require an 
amendment to the contract? Answer - Yes they can change, so the field needs 
to be date effective, but would like it to be an administrative amendment 
with new request form signed by the shipper ( not an amendment through the 
contract). This would be a change for all their LFT contracts since marketing 
wants to keep it simple at an LE Shipper Level.
Item 3. Can the waiver be date sensitive? Answer -  Yes, Susan Scott will 
review the request form and make any changes needed. I will forward a copy of 
the draft I did to you and marketing and Susan to review.
Item 4. Is the contracts group suppose to be the keeper of the waiver? Answer 
- Yes, Marketing suggested that a LFT Waiver book be set up, then also they 
would like a copy of the signed request form to be in each LFT contract file.
Item 5. When is the shipper suppose to submit the waiver - at request time? 
Answer - Yes at the time they are executing their first LFT contract. When we 
have the system changes in production, I will let marketing know, & they will 
advise the shippers of this new waiver.
Item 6. Where will the waiver reside? With the request, on the Web under 
blank forms? Answer - Yes, on the web, under Contracts-blank forms for  TW. 

Please let me know if you have any other issues.
Thanks Ramona

Subject: Re: TW's LFT changes

Lorraine,
I talked with Linda Trevino this morning about  the LFT waiver & from what I 
could remember we  decided to send the  form letter for the waiver  with the 
LFT contract so it would be effective for the time frame of the LFT 
agreement. The system should default to no waiver which means the LFT shipper 
would be scheduled to zero when we call an LFT day at their point. If we have 
the waiver, then the flag will be set to yes. During scheduling we will 
schedule their LFT as overrun if capacity at the point was available. I do 
not have a draft waiver form, but I can get a copy of one that NNG uses.  You 
may want to address these issues from Linda. See her questions below.

Subject: Sierra Pacific Resources Announces Sale of Las Vegas Power Plant


  RENO, NEVADA, Dec. 11/PR Newswire/  Sierra
 Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP), parent company of Nevada
 Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company, today
 announced that Nevada Power Company has agreed to sell the
 Sunrise Station electric generating plant in Las Vegas,
 Nev., to Reliant Energy Power Generation, Inc., a
 subsidiary of Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI). The sale
 includes two generating units owned by Nevada Power and
 rights to electricity produced by three additional units
 on the Sunrise site owned by an independent power
 producer.

  The sale price of the generating station was $106
 million, subject to taxes and other adjustments at
 closing. In conjunction with the purchase, Nevada Power
 negotiated the right to buy energy and ancillary services
 from Reliant Energy Power Generation for agreed upon
 prices from closing until March 1, 2003, at a cost of $73
 million based on time of closing. This will result in a
 net price for the generating plant upon closing of
 approximately $33 million.

  ""With the sale of Sunrise Station, divestiture of
 our generation assets is nearly complete. The buyer is a
 leader in power generation and has already established a
 strong presence in southern Nevada,"" said Walter M.
 Higgins, chairman, president and chief executive officer
 of Sierra Pacific Resources. ""We'll soon be able to devote
 all our resources to building the best energy transmission
 and distribution company in the West.""

  Sunrise Station consists of two generating units
 that can be fueled by natural gas or oil capable of
 producing up to 149 megawatts of electricity. The facility
 also includes three additional gas turbine generating
 units rated at 222 megawatts. These three units are owned
 by an independent power producer, Nevada Sun-Peak Limited
 Partnership, under contract to Nevada Power. All five of
 the units are located on a 38-acre site at the base of
 Frenchman Mountain near the eastern edge of Las Vegas.
 There are no regular full-time employees at Sunrise
 Station.

  Sale of the generating assets is a regulatory
 condition of the 1999 merger of Sierra Pacific Resources
 and Nevada Power. The sale is expected to close in
 mid-2001, subject to approval and review by various
 regulatory agencies.

  The company intends to complete the sale and
 transfer of all its generating assets in Nevada in 2001.

  Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial
 advisor to Sierra Pacific Resources on the Sunrise Station
 sale. Navigant Consulting served as the technical advisor.

  Headquartered in Nevada, Sierra Pacific Resources
 is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are
 Nevada Power Company, the electric utility for southern
 Nevada; and Sierra Pacific Power Company, the electric
 utility for most of northern Nevada and the Lake Tahoe
 area of California, and a natural gas and water
 distributor in the Reno-Sparks area. Other subsidiaries
 include the Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company, which owns 50
 percent interest in an interstate natural gas transmission
 partnership; and Sierra Pacific Communications, a
 telecommunications company.

  Reliant Energy and a partner jointly own and
 operate El Dorado Energy, a 480-megawatt, natural
 gas-fired facility southeast of Las Vegas. In October,
 Reliant Energy announced plans to construct a
 500-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant about 20 miles
 north of Las Vegas, off Interstate 15.

  Based in Houston, Tex., Reliant Energy is an
 international energy services and energy delivery company
 with $20 billion in annual revenue and assets totaling $30
 billion. The company has a wholesale energy trading and
 marketing business that ranks among the top five in the
 U.S. in combined electricity and natural gas volumes and a
 presence in most of the major power regions of the U.S.
 The company has nearly 27,000 megawatts of power
 generation in operation in the U.S. and Western Europe and
 has announced acquisitions and development projects that
 will add another 4,000 megawatts.

Subject: Revised Transportation Proposal

Hi Ed - Here is a revised comprehensive summary of the firm transportation 
proposal between Red Cedar and Transwestern:

Term:  5 years, January 1, 2001through December 31, 2005

Year	Volume	Rate(+option fee)
1	125,000 MMBtu/d*	$0.02/MMbtu/d
2	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.025/MMBtu/d
3	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.03/MMBtu/d
4	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.035/MMBtu/d
5	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.04/MMBtu/d
		

Option:  Red Cedar shall have a one-time option to reduce its contract MDQ 
for contract years 4 - 5 to a volume between 100,000 MMBtu/d - 150,000 
MMBtu/d.  Red Cedar may trigger this option anytime before November 30, 
2003.  Option fee is an incremental one-tenth of one cent/MMBtu (additive to 
the above quoted rates) over the five year term.

Facility Modifications:  The current cost estimate to increase the meter 
capacity (from 200,000 MMBtu/d to 300,000 MMBtu/d) at the Arkansas Loop Plant 
into Transwestern is $378,000.  * Year 1 capacity of 125,000 MMBtu is 
dependent upon the completion of these facility modifications.  Red Cedar 
will fund these facility modifications (by a one-time payment of $378,000 
payable prior to Transwestern ordering material for the modifications).  In 
order to avoid the tax gross-up of approximately $130,000, the $378,000 will 
be amortized over the term of the contract and booked as ""pre-paid"" 
transportation fees.  (The net effect of this will be zero because the slight 
increase/MMBtu which will show up on the monthly transportation invoice will 
be negated by the corresponding credit for the pre-paid transportation.)

Please call me to discuss.  Thanks.

    WASHINGTON (AP)   Federal regulators voted Monday to order price
restraints on electricity sales across the West but not the
stringent cost-based controls sought by California.
    The 5-0 vote by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
followed intense pressure not only from California Gov. Gray Davis
and Democrats newly in charge of the Senate but also from House
Republicans worried that spiraling power prices in the West could
affect the 2002 election.
    FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert said the order, effective through
September 2002, will benefit consumers but also will ``provide
every incentive for suppliers to reduce costs.''
    The order expands price restrictions the agency imposed in April
on wholesale electricity sales in California during peak demand
periods when blackouts were threatened.

CA ISO is filing jointly with SCE and SDG&E.  The comments begin with a tyrade that FERC has no right to condition price caps on joining an RTO.  Apparently, they weakly support regional organizations and note agreement to work with the other RTOs that are now forming.

PG&E is filing separate comments ""because of its bankruptcy."" PG&E will note concern about the CA ISO ""independence"" and talks about other RTOs as potentially good options.

The CPUC ordered and berated PG&E to file its comments with the CPUC BEFORE submitting them to FERC.  PG&E initially protested, but was threatened with fines.  It finally filed yesterday under seal.

Bottomline:

I believe that the joint ISO/IOU filing is structured to provide the minimal needed to meet the FERC test. Therefore, FERC's price caps will remain in effect.

SoCal gas has announced that it may have to curtail gas to power plants this summer.  SoCal Gas says it has to put gas in storage for winter and may not be able to do that and serve the power plants. Apparently, SoCal is shipping gas to Mexico at the same time. That will not look good to CA politicians.

Opposition to ISO Compliance Filing On Creditworthiness Standards
The ISO made a compliance filing that greatly expands its creditworthiness 
exemptions, far beyond what FERC had ordered in its 2/14/01 order.  The ISO's 
tariff language can be read to allow the utilities to count the credit status 
of third parties as their own, without the third parties' approvals.  Enron 
will oppose.  The filing is due 3/22/01.

Also Bracewell is making or has made the following CA filings (these are all 
I know about anyway):

Tucson Electric Complaint   Intervention  vanilla 3/19   Done for Sanders 
 no RCR
PNM Complaint   Support   3/22 Done for Sanders  no RCR
FERC Staff Report  Support EPSA/WPTF 3/22 Plan to do for <$500
      and raise temporal issue of western resources
City of San Diego  Intervene/comment 3/28 Probably will be done for Sanders

The underscheduling filing was put on hold.  We were mistaken when we thought 
that comments on an ISO proposal were due 3/22.   Instead, we've now decided 
to file comments in response to the ISO's filing of tariff changes, which 
should be made soon.

That's all for the rest of March, so far.  I'll be updating Jim's table on 
pending FERC matters.

Enron has been giving $10,000 annually to the Law & Organizational Economics Center for several years for their programs providing economic education to state judges.  I have been following the program and have been impressed by the quality of presentations and professors lecturing to state officials on such things as opportunity cost, cost/benefit analysis, and risk analysis.  Many of these judges have not had much training in economics.

Attached is a note from Henry Butler about moving his program from the University of Kansas to Chapman University, which was due to an additional financial support and a better location for operations.  A spreadsheet at the bottom shows the total number of state judges who have gone through his program since it began in the mid-1990s by state.

I have recommended to the Enron Foundation (Misha Siegel and Elyse Kalmans) that we renew the support in 2002.  You opinion might be asked as well, so I wanted to provide this to you.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Rob,

In our earlier meeting with Lay, he seemed to want to talk about changes in
the corporate ""visions"" over time. He also seemed interested in exploring the
idea of corporate culture. Both of these themes can be included under the
broad heading of strategic vision and the creation of a corporate culture
capable of pursuing that vision.

Specific questions are more difficult to imagine at this point. I think we
should rely on the general approach taken with Skilling and Sutton: How were
the various ""visions"" that have guided Enron's development been defined? How
were they achieved? What do you see as the key issues that should be
addressed in our history?  Who are the crucial ""cluster"" of people to
interview for each issue? How do you see this project being used within Enron?
I'll bet we can have a very productive hour with these general questions.

Here is a draft of your talk on ""The Evolution of the Modern Energy Company.""

I have it as a straight talk, but we could fashion together slides and drop a 
lot of this to talking points if you prefer.

There is some new historical material in the front to set up the heart of the 
talk; see if you think it is interesting enough as a lead in.

I'm on your calendar at 9:30 to discuss this or ""The Future of Business"" if 
you would like new information or changes.

The suggested amount for you/Enron is $200,00012.5% of the total.  Enron 
gave $50,000 for the 2000 effort, which was about 8% of the total they ended 
up raising ($617,000).   it is your call on what is reasonable, and keep in 
mind there might be another round later on.

We have been working on a list of potential donors with ""A"" being the 
impacted such as refiners and petrochemical companies and ""B"" being 
beneficiaries such as contractors.  Ned Holmes office suggested that you pick 
the names of the potential donors for the Enron visit and he will just take 
the rest.  The list is being updated, so we will have to wait until the 
meeting to look at it.

I have invited the following individuals to join us at the 3 pm Thursday 
meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas 
situation.

Hamd AlhkayatHamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be 
helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's 
speeches.

Shelley CormanShelley has been developing messages for the current and 
anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group.  
(The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.)

Stinson GibnerStinson is with the research group that has generated some of 
the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic 
futures pricing.

Gil MuhlGil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.  
His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter 
volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
meeting.

Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
overview of the situation as the ""teacher"" or ""professor.""  Some questions 
that you could address would include:

Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?

How is the business different today?

What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?

I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
before and after your keynote is that you have ""been there"" in the evolution 
of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to 
stress the need for new industry ""best practices"" (more hedging) and the 
right public policies to deal with this issue (from ""do no harm"" to expanding 
incentives in the market).

The attached one pager describes an embryonic idea for a new philanthropy 
venture that might be of interest for your panel discussion with Michael Dell 
at the Fortune conference on October 12th.

It is inspired by the populist arguments on the campaign trail against 
partial social security privatization.  I believe that if a greater number of 
Americans were corporate investors there would be a greater buy in to not 
only social security reform but to sound economic policies.  I also believe 
that redistributionist arguments would carry less weight.

Barton Smith of UH will share the results of the economic study he is 
co-directing on the costs and benefits of the Houston region complying with 
the TNRCC SIP for ozone.  (This is the Greater Houston Partnership study I

The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the 
total benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently 
proposed) are below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad 
air days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are 
around $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including 
the assumption of today's best technology but no more.  The high costs 
include a ""last mile"" problem that the proposal of the Partnership's Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight 
construction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and 
future permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).

The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not 
eliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the 
current SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000about a 
1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This ""shock"" will be around 
one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 
according to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) 
is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.

It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election 
over), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's 
office and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal 
unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the 
study next month.

As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a 
top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are 
considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not 
intended to be a ""whining"" study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
(naturally) bring into review some ""last mile"" problems where certain SIP 
measures are the least cost effective.

These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
in and should not be shared externally.

The NAESB Bylaws include minimum requirements for meeting attendance of Board and EC members.  The requirements are the same for Board and EC reps.  Members must attend, in person, at least 25% of scheduled meetings and must participate in at least 75% of such meetings.  Attendance will be reviewed each March 31 and September 30 for the preceding twelve months.

The 2002 meeting schedule has not been finalized (neither dates nor locations).  In the past, all Board meetings and most EC meetings have been held in Houston.  For NAESB, this will change.  For 2002, none of the Board meetings will be in Houston and possibly none of the EC meetings will be in Houston.  Starting in June the EC meetings will probably move to two-day meetings (as they were in the past) because more than one quadrant may be in attendance.  New standards will be brought before the EC for vote.  New quadrants will probably have a flurry of new standards  hopefully not to the extent we had at the beginning of GISB.  Below is the meeting schedule as I know it thus far:

BOARD
March 7 - Washington D.C.
June 28 - TBD
Sept 18 - Baltimore, MD
Nov 21 - TBD

EC
Feb 21 - FP&L in Palm Beach, Florida
April 18 - TBD
June 13 - Boeing in Seattle, WA
Aug 8 - TBD
Oct 17 - Phoenix, AZ (tentative)
Dec 12  looking for host in New York, NY

The Board still has some transition issues to address, but I think a good deal of the transition has been taken care of.  For a while issues will continue to arise as we move through our processes, such as the one regarding GISB Operating Practices that I mentioned in my last update e-mail.

Activity in the EC slowed almost to a stop due in part to the Order 637 work being done by various subcommittees.  This held up the work on requests.  BPS has only a few requests on their plate.  In January, IR should finalize their work on Order 637 and resume work on their backlog of requests.  ETS has approximately 30 requests submitted to GISB; most are in IR.

One thing to watch for in the EC is standards that spill over into the wholesale gas quadrant from other quadrants.  If a standard is being adopted by another quadrant, EC reps in our quadrant can decide that the standard should apply to our quadrant as well.  The vote needed to have our quadrant address the standard is simple majority, which does not require support by the pipeline segment.  The final adoption of the standard requires a 17/2 vote.

New NAESB procedures may also be raised by other quadrants that affect adoption of standards or the organization as a whole.  These would be addressed by either the Board or the EC, depending on the nature of the procedure.

Thanks,

GISB Standard 2.3.41 states that imbalance trading should be allowed through at least the 17th business day of the month.  The language of the standard is as follows:

This timing will need to be incorporated into the timeline.

In addition to the usual comments, the FERC is requesting comments on whether they should adopt the revisions to the capacity release timeline (5.3.2).  I spoke with Joe Hartsoe.  I feel we should comment in favor of adopting 5.3.2.  The timing is preferable to the FERC's findings in the CIG order, etc.  Parties such as the LDCs (Mike Novak) may see this as an opportunity to renege on the consensus agreements made in GISB.

Most of the pipeline EC reps are still out for the holidays  I haven't been able to find out whether they will comment.  I'll work on this next week.

The FERC is also proposing to eliminate existing section 284.12(a), which deals with EBBs.  They've noted this is clean-up of the regulations.  Similar requirements for Internet communications are contained in other regs.  I'll check the regs and let you know what I find.  There probably won't be any need to comment on this.

Comments are due February 1.  Nancy Bagot will coordinate our comments.  I'll work with her.  Implementation date is three months after a final rule is issued.

Section 18.1 of the bylaws states that quadrant procedures can be amended by majority vote of the Directors representing that quadrant.

Jay is keeping a list of inconsistencies / errors that are discovered.  If we find errors, we should send them to Rae to be added to the list.  She suggested the new Parliamentary Committee address the list  possibly after NAESB has been up and running for one year.

A vote will be taken to change the version 1.5 'GISB' standards to 'NAESB' standards.  There's been some discussion on the proper way to vote (e.g., 17/2, procedural).  It will probably be a 17/2 vote.  I don't think it matters.  The only issue I see is that people will want to make it clear that this 17/2 vote should not be interpreted as a vote in favor of each and every standard.  It is only a vote in favor of changing the standards to NAESB.  A comment can be made on the record.

The 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas' will be voted.  We have not been involved with or concerned about this document since we will not use it.  If a motion is made to accept it, I plan to vote in favor.  Comments have been submitted and it appears that this recommendation may be sent back to subcommittee for further work.  I'll go along with this if motioned.

Last December the EC adopted revisions to standards based on the recommendations in the Sandia Labs Report.  These revisions have been incorporated into GISB's response document, which has been distributed to the EC.  This response document was received earlier this week; I have not verified GISB's work.  This item is not on the EC agenda, so I don't know the specific intent.  They may want the EC to approve the final version  which means approving GISB's work.  I have a concern with that type of vote.  They may want the EC to approve the 'Executive Summary' and 'Conclusion' (total 3 pages).  I have no problem with that vote except that these documents have not been updated since the December revisions were made and are no longer correct.  I'll take care of during the EC meeting.  (NOTE: The revisions to standards have not been distributed for ratification.)

The plan is to bring the response document before the Board at their March meeting for ""approval"".  The response should also be reviewed by the Editorial Review Board.

You should receive the Board book in the next 2 - 3 days.  It will be mailed directly to you.

The NAESB office has not yet set up the conference call.  When available, they'll send the phone number and passcode to me.  I'll forward to you.

ADDITIONAL NAESB BOARD NOTES
During the Board meeting, a Provisional Activity was moved to the active section of the annual plan.  The intent was to only move the partial day recall order.  However, the provisional item included two FERC orders  related to partial day recalls and affiliates.  I couldn't hear the discussion, but have been informed that the affiliate order was not mentioned and that the entire item was moved.  This needs to be corrected so the affiliate order is not on NAESB's annual plan.  I'll work with the EC reps to determine how we want to handle.  Your suggestions are welcome.
Per NAESB's Certificate, a Board member cannot have a substitute at a Board meeting.  During yesterday's meeting, Jack Hawks sat in and VOTED for his boss, Lyn Maddox (Services - PG&E Energy Trading).  Jack has been very involved in the Wholesale Electric Quadrant.  Immediately after the meeting, Boswell and Jay Costan were questioned about this voting.  Jay stated it is allowed per NAESB governance, but then determined it is not.  After some dancing and backpedaling, they noted that the resolution would go out for notational vote.  I don't have the vote count on the adoption of the quadrant procedures.  The promotional dues would not have been adopted without Jack's vote.
Shelley  You asked what company Boswell works for.  I've been told that he is a ""non-employee officer"" of Dominion.  The NAESB listing of Board members states he is ""Assistant Secretary, Dominion"".  He is also a partner at McGuire Woods  same firm as Jay Costan.  During meetings (including non-NAESB), I've heard him introduce himself only as Chairman of NAESB's Board of Directors; he doesn't give a company affiliation.  His e-mail address is McGuire Woods.
The voting on quadrant procedures did not synch up with my discussion with Rae.  She stated the votes would be simple majority; super majority votes were taken.  Some people feel NAESB officers were concerned that some segments would not support the procedures, which would bring NAESB to a standstill.  My call to Rae may have piqued their curiosity and raised concerns.  We'll see whether this item remains on Jay Costan's list of errors in the bylaws.
Bill Boswell will soon appoint Board members to the new Parliamentary Committee.  It will consist of two members from each Quadrant (not each Segment) and will address governance issues (e.g., Certificate, Bylaws, Operating Procedures).  It's been suggested that the Pipeline Board members should try to get a seat on that committee.  Recommendations from the Parliamentary Committee should still be voted by the entire Board.  However, their recommendations from a Board committee will have a good chance of being adopted.  My feeling is that Ron Mucci may be interested; I've heard no discussion.

RATES AND REVENUE (RRS)
I've met with Gerry Medeles and Jim Studebaker to discuss RRS.  Initially, I'll attend most meetings to get up to speed and to help where I can with business requirements.  I'm also reviewing as much of the documentation as possible to gather information.

TRADING PARTNER AGREEMENT (TPA)
I've met with Mary Draemer to discuss our pro forma TPA.  It's my understanding that we are using the language of the GISB (NAESB) standard agreement.  We don't know the history of our TPA, but at some point the standard agreement was reformatted and the GISB standard number and copyright info was deleted.
I'll prepare our pro forma TPA, based on the GISB standard.  I'll add certain pieces of information, which we include in our posted pro forma, to the standard agreement.  This will be routed to the attorneys to give them a quick heads-up.  I'll explain that the content has not been changed.
I'll prepare the agreements for UBS and send to them for execution.  The agreements will then be routed to the attorney and then to Shelley for execution.
Shelley  Will you sign for NNG?  If not, who will sign?


NAESB EDM SUBCOMMITTEE
The EDM Subcommittee has begun having frequent meetings.  They have three requests on their plate in addition to their requirement to review the appendices in the EDM book to determine whether updates are needed for the technical characteristics.  The requester wants their changes included in version 1.6.  And, most feel the updates to the appendices are needed in version 1.6.  I'm still working with Terry Lehn on EDM matters.

MOVING NEXT WEEK
My move is scheduled for next Thursday; packed by Wednesday.  I'll do some cleaning out to downsize from office to cubicle.  I'll leave some files in the 47th floor file room until I can go through them.  I want to make sure I have electronic copies before I throw away Board and EC books, standards, etc.  I'll work with Donna Scott on storage."

Thanks for the email.  I'm sure Paul has spoken to you by now.... but, Paul 
has sold 100% of this gas based on a Questar price for the entire month of 
November.  So, we [Entrada/Crescendo] will be receiving the IF Questar flat 
price no matter what pipe it flows on for November.  So, for November, it 
doesn't matter to me how you flow the gas, as long as it flows.  If moving 
this gas to NWPL helps you guys and doesn't cut into 100% of their gas 
flowing, then I suppose you can do what you see fit.

Subject: Re: Wildhorse Letter  

Gerald 

I have provided a few coments (redlined) to your draft letter attached below.

However, I wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and 
the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the Wildhorse letter:

 A.  Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the 
shut-in status of Entrada production?  Should we request written notification 
related to the recent curtailment of Dakota production?  [As we've discussed, 
Enogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we do not have 
any historic documentation of Wildhorse's claims].

 B.  Should we identify (potential) contractual issues due to the curtailment 
of Dakota production; e.g.  Sec. 6 detailing the (wellhead) delivery pressure 
requirements under this contract, et al?  [As we've discussed, the system 
pressures have increased due to (initially) gas being re-routed by Wildhorse 
over the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system, and now the 
NWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased 
pressures system-wide.  If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these 
problems to persist by referring to Sec. 7 ""Gas Quality"" of the agreement, 
what remedies can we request....partial release of Dakota gas?].

Here's the frustration, based on conversations with producers in the area and 
the documents we've received from Enogex, Wildhorse has continued to attach 
non-pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to 
increase gathering revenues, yet has not invested any $$$ for processing of 
this gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines.  Then, they use 
the downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive 
producers, and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and 
quality issues discussed above.  Therefore, its critical that this letter 
gets to the ""right"" people within Wildhorse and, if possible, make reference 
to some element of timing (e.g., reasonable dispatch, commercially reasonable 
manner, etc.). 


Thanks.

Dan




"
joan.quick@enron.com,"

I just found out that our nom on Wildhorse s/b in mcfs, not in mmbtus.  So, 
that will confuse matters.  Per Wildhorse we have an imbalance of 500 per day 
[3,200 mcf/d nom vs actuals of 2,700 mcf/d] - 16,000 for Oct.  Thus, per 
Wildhorse, we need to reduce the nom to around 2,200 mcf/d in order to come 
back in line.   The concern with reducing the nom should not affect the VPP 
volumes, but it will affect the excess volume [pricing] because for the month 
of November, Paul Lucci has sold the 3,200 mmbtu/d as baseload.  Stacy Brewer 
[ENA scheduler] will discuss with Paul.  Thus, if we reduce our nom, it will 
affect his baseload market and he will have to go out and buy gas in order to 
keep his market whole, and prices have gone up mid month.  [Mark Whitt - I 
know this is mixing mcfs and mmbtus and in reality it's not as simply stated 
as above].

In discussions with Jim, Dan Reineke [sp?] will get Wildhorse's actuals from 
their acctg group, then he will reconcile his numbers with theirs, and come 
up with the final actual numbers.  Apparently that will take him about a 
day.  So, we need to wait til actuals get reconciled in order to figure out 
what our imbalance is.  We do need to reduce our nom from 3,200 mcf/d to 
3,000 mcf/d, but Liz said to hold off on that for now.

Per disc with Jim Osborne and Liz Orr, 11/15 pm.

We made our first of the month nom into Questar for December.  As you know, 
the Mesa Tap compressor into Questar is down [drive shaft is broken], so this 
gas cannot move into Questar for the first.  I have spoken with Paul Lucci 
our physical trader, and he has found a market for the gas on NWPL for the 
2nd thru the 4th.  In talking with Wildhorse, they believe the compressor 
will be back up on the 7th.  Thus, Paul is trying to find a NWPL market on 
the 5th and 6th.  The gas on the 1st will be applied to Wildhorse imbalance.

		 Subject: Western Governors update

Allhad a good meeting with Governor Owens today.  Also in attendance were 
Roy Palmer (chief of staff), Alan Philp (special assistant), Joel Harris 
(senior policy aide to the governor).  The good Governor stated his strong 
disagreement of price caps and that he would oppose any efforts to impose 
them on the western states.  He will be a stong ally for us in this debate. 
He stopped short of offering to ""rally the republican troops"", but did offer 
that he thought most of his colleagues would be of the same mindset.  He will 
not be attending the Feb 2 meeting, but his policy guy is empowered to 
speak/vote on his behalf if any type of vote comes before the WGA membership 
at that time. Since this WGA debate is probably going to continue into 2001, 
we will plan on keeping in close touch with Gov. Owens and his staff.

The Governor will be attending a world economic summit in Davos starting 
tomorrow, and indicated that he will be having dinner with Ken Lay at that 
event.  He again stated his appreciation for Mr. Lay's support in the past as 
well as his high regard for Mr. Lay's business practices.  

I have invited the Governor'spolicy folks to tour our trading floor on 
Thursday Feb 1 in Portland if they come in early.  I have also promised them 
an outline of possible solutions/ideas that could be considered by the WGA 
instead of price caps.  Paul has already put a draft together of such a 
document, and we will make sure that everyone on this list sees a copy of our 
ideas before sending them on.

1  Why is the term ""Legacy"" often used and does it mean something other than 
""old way of doing things""


2.  Why is a business customer called an ""Enterprise"" customer?  Does it have 
something to do with the size of the customer?  The type of customer?  Or is 
it just a fancy name for a customer.

1.  The difference between recommended standard (RS) and single-mode fiber

2.  What is an indefeasible right of use (IRU)?  It is like a right-of-way?

3.  What are the differences in the various capacities of cable (DS-3, 
OC-192, etc.).  Not just the amount of capacity each has, but what types of 
information are transmitted along each.

4.  What is a synchronous optical network (SONET)?

5.  What is asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)? 

6.  What is synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)?  I think this is used in 
Europe, but I'm not sure.

7.  What is a bi-directional line switched ring (BLSR)?

8.  What is throughput capacity?

9.  What does the term ""long haul"" mean?

10.  I still don't have a grasp of the 10% rule.  Unfortunately, I think I

As you all know, there were several governors events over the past 3 to 4 
days in Washington DC:

Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringer's office.  They 
would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could 
participate in an Energy council that is being formed (actually commissioned 
by the legislature) to study energy issues for the state.  Geringer would 
also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an 
assets based to a market based entity.  

We had contacted Scott Cealy (spelling) with Arizona Governor Hull's office 
last week and  Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and 
had a chance to thank her for her  leadership in opposing price caps. Mr. 
Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to 
see them. I will schedule that meeting (boy that Paul must have been charming 
at dinner!!!)

I sat with Gary Smith, political guy with Gov Kempthorne's office who 
indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on 
Tuesday afternoon.  Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting 
with Cheney, but there was speculation that he may not come.  I have not 
confirmed the outcome of that meeting, but was invited by Mr. Smith to call 
him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow.  I will place that call and see 
what I can find out.  Mr. Racicot was going to get back to us on what he 
found out from Kempthorne-has Linda or Rick heard from him?  I will be 
continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to 
him.

We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March 30 that Governor 
Owens is sponsoring.  Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens 
staff.  As most of you know from previous updates, Owens is strong in his 
support against price caps and market based solutions.

At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance 
from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber.  Lindahow do we want to 
follow up on that request?

Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed 
with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door 
open to future discussions.  Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for 
now.

We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt.  I will continue to 
work on setting that up.  Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to 
meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock 
on that door.  We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some 
commercial reasons.

There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info, 
etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights.

		 Subject: more on FERC meeting

Paul et alin addition to the comments that I made specific to California on 
the previous e mail, there were a few other observations that might be of 
interest. 

Governor Kempthorne made opening comments and used fairly strong comments 
against price caps.  

US Senator Larry Craig made opening comments, including the statement ""price 
caps ......an easy political decision to make, once it's made, it's 
impossible to change"".  He stayed for the entire meeting, and I got the 
impression that he was traveling with Hebert.  

The Chairman from Colorado (Raymond Gifford)  was particularly strong in his 
advocacy against price caps as were the 2 participants from Arizona.

The Chairman from Nevada asked that Walt Higgins (CEO of Sierra Pacific?) be 
able to make comments on the record.  Mr Higgins' testimony was vrey good for 
our cause, both in substance and ""message"" wise.  He basically said that if 
price caps were put in place, he would be punished for having hedged and put 
together a balanced portfolio to be able serve his customers effectively.  
Breathitt seemed to have a relationship with him so he might be a another 
good sounding board for her?

As stated in the article that Dasovich sent around, Hebert tallied the votes 
at the end of the meeting.  Although all of the republican governors are 
against price caps, three of the commissioners from those states were open to 
considering some type of ""price mitigation plan""  (this is apparently the new 
word for price caps because all of the proponents of price caps kept using 
it) with lots of caveats.  Those commissioners were Schafer from New Mexico, 
White from Utah, and Smith from Idaho.

Lastly, Commissioner Breathitt was accurately protrayed in the article.  She 
seemed increasingly angst ridden as the meeting went on and at the end of the 
meeting stated that she really wanted the FERC to consider a price mitigation 
plan and the she ""had a lot of thinking to do"".






"
susan.landwehr@enron.com,"

Unfortunately, Gov Owens will be leaving for an overseas trip this week and 
will not be attending the Feb 2 meeting in Portland, so our hope that he 
would be a stong  voice at the meeting is not going to happen.  I think that 
we can get some good work done with the staff, and good support in the long 
term, but we need to look beyond Owens for this meeting.

I got the sense over the weekend that Kempthorne is going to be pretty active 
on this issue, and since he is the chair of the WGA, he will be running the 
meeting.  In talking with FERC Commissioner Hebert at one of the inaugural 
events, he indicated that Kempthorne seemed to be pretty reluctant to take on 
the mantle of market solutions.  Paul has a meeing with Kempthorne's office 
on Friday of this week, so we'll be working on convincing him to be an 
advocate.  

As you know, Jim Souby from WGA did eventually make room on the panel for the 
FEB 2 meeting for us.  A letter of invitation should be on it's way to Steve 
Kean if it has not already been received.  

 I saw Hap Boyd and he says that Enron Wind is participating on Feb. 2 in the 
afternoon session.

		 Subject: Re: FERC Hearing in Boise

Jeffyou did such a good job that I don't have to type much.   I do have a 
few other thoughts to share that may be helpful for the California folks.

The format, although somewhat informal, had a  court reporter present and 
transcripts will be published. Each state was invited to have 2 
representatives and one of the 2 had to be a Commission member.  Opening 
comments were taken from each state and then specific topics were discussed.  
Herzberg participated primarily in the opening discussion. 

He came across as very sincere-indicated that they were working ""around the 
clock"" to take care of their problems, but that they cannot do it alone.  He 
asked for FERC to help get Califonia to ""stabilization"" and specifically 
asked FERC for three actions:  an 18 month temporary price cap on 
electricity,  an 18 month temporary price cap on natural gas prices and to 
prohibit any withholding of pipeline capacity to California.  

He was treated very respectfully (which was not as evident  in the comments 
to Commissioner Brown), and I think he did his cause some good.  Much more so 
that in other venues when I've seen other reps from Davis's office speak.  
Breathitt came to California's defense at some point in the discussion.

Commissioner Brown did his share of ranting about EVERYBODY knowing that 
market manipulation is taking place and that the bastards were going to pay 
for their misdeeds (ok..he didn't use those words, but his message was clear)

Lastly, the Chair of the Montana was the most vocal and honest in his 
comments to the California partcipants stating, in part,  ""why should Montana 
ratepayers be taking the hit because California didn't build power plants.""

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

Per our discussions I am writing this note to formally request a regulatory 
opinion regarding the status and possible outcomes with respect to QF PPA 
restructuring in California.  As we discussed, ENA is currently conducting 
due diligence efforts on 2 California QF assets; Mt. Poso and Ace.  Both of 
these assets have SO4 PPAs.  Mt. Poso's is with PG&E and Ace's is with 
Edison.    By the time we acquire these assets, both will be receiving SRAC 
energy prices.  As part of this process, we need to be able to quantify (as 
best we can)  what impact  current PUC discussions will have on the switch 
from SRAC to PX.   Specifically we would like an opinion on the following:

1.) What is the projected timing for switching from SRAC to PX.  This can be 
in the form of a timing probability.  (ie. 50:50 in the next year, etc)

2.) Discussions are ongoing concerning what if any capacity payments are 
imbedded in the PX payments.  Based on what you know on how these discussions 
are moving forward, can you lay out a best case, worst case and most likely 
scenario.   A summary of the possible equation for calculating the new PX 
pricing would be helpful.

3.) You mentioned the possible transition from a transmission losses discount 
to a GMM adjustment.  Any comments you have on these discussions would be 
useful.

Any other comments you may have in regards to the above or the due diligence 
efforts in general would be appreciated.

 If you have any questions please call me at 503-464-3836.

Here's one that's ""final,"" not draft, that just came out.  I'm assuming that 
this is the one the press is refering to.  Let me know that you think.
"
michael.etringer@enron.com,"

Below is the email I sent Milton and an attached outline sheet.  Milton 
indicated the he would discuss the idea with Rich Purcell, apparently a main 
partner in the project.  He seemed to be genuinely interested and felt it was 
something Rich would also like.  

The question is, ""Can we facilitate, through the QFs, a contract 
restructuring with PG&E and if so what steps would we propose at this point 
?""(assuming I get interest back from Burney Forest Products.)  I would 
propose that ENA work with the QF to structure the terms of the ""restructed"" 
PPA between the QF and PG&E and that simultaneous with that agreement, ENA 
enter into a long term services deal to supply the market based energy as 
well as provide for an up-fron option premium for the right to ""put"" market 
based power to the QF/utility.

Let me know your thoughts.

Mike
-"
michael.etringer@enron.com,"

Understanding there are many nuances and directions for discussing a contract 
restructuring with the QFs, I am attaching a general outline of a potential 
structure we (Chris Foster and I)  would like to pitch to Wheelabrator.  
Could you look this over and provide your initial comments.  I have thought 
of providing more specific terms in regards to sharing % and potential up 
front payments for the optionality but would like you input.  For example, we 
could apply an option value to the deal.  In Wheelabrator's case, the 
intrinsic reverse toll (ie our ability to provide market based power to the 
IOU using SRAC at 9210 HeatRate) is in the range of $4-5 MM for the Malin gas 
pricing and $9-11 MM if we assume the combined Socal/Malin curve.  If we 
lower the contract heat rate to 8500 the intrinsic value drops about $2 MM.  
The other alternative, which may be the easiest to sell,  is to just agree 
with the IOU/PUC on a lower heat rate and the Malin curve.  

Another value upside, and probably the highest value in the short run, is to 
be able to optimize the QF contract deliverability obligations. (ie.  in a 
very simplified case, if the obligation is only 80 percent, then deliver 80 
%). 

I will give you a call or call me when you have a free moment.

NOTICE: COH OFO/OMO

Date Issued: December 11, 2000 

As a result of returning cold weather and significant under-deliveries by 
shippers on the Columbia Gas of Ohio (COH) system, COH is calling an 
Operational Flow Order and an Operational Matching Order (OMO) for all COH 
Gas Transportation Customers. The OFO/OMO is effective on gas day December 
13, 2000 and will remain in effect until further notice. If conditions 
warrant, these orders will be lifted to reflect the changing conditions and 
COH will advise you of such changes. Customer and marketer banks are not 
available during the OFO/OMO period. 

This notice is applicable to the Customer Choice program. CHOICE deliveries 
should always equal the customers demand curve. The OFO requires the same 
level of delivery, but the tariff provides for additional costs for failure 
to comply.

Customers with daily measurement devices are subject to the OMO. Those 
customers or their shippers are directed to adjust the customer's consumption 
and/or their deliveries to COH so that their deliveries to COH are equal to 
the customer's actual consumption.

Customers without daily measurement devices are subject to the OFO. Those 
customers are hereby directed to adjust their daily scheduled deliveries to 
COH so that those deliveries are equal to 60% of the customer's maximum daily 
volume as specified in the customer's gas transportation contract with COH.

Those customers or their shippers who fail to comply with this OFO/OMO shall 
be subject to penalties for the difference as provided for in COH's tariff. 
COH will continue to monitor weather conditions and demand, in order to 
remove the OFO/OMO as soon as possible.

If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact your Columbia Gas 
Representative.

GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road.  I say give
the road to the chickens and let them decide.  The government needs to let
go of strangling the chickens so they can get across
the road.

SENATOR LIEBERMAN
I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God In their
own way.  Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no chicken should be
denied the right to cross the road in their own
way.

SECRETARY CHENEY
Chickens are big-time because they have wings. They could fly if they
wanted to.  Chickens don't want to cross the road.  They don't need help
crossing the road.  In fact, I'm not interested in crossing the road
myself.

RALPH NADER
Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil
tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tiremakers to
create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing
there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with
chickens.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay!  Isn't it obvious? Can't you people See the
plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the ""other
side."" That's what ""they"" call it-the ""other side."" Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you
will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like ""the other side."" That chicken should not be free to cross the
road.  It's as plain and simple as that.

DR.  SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The
chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die.  In the rain.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without having
their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
that the chicken crossed the road,and that was good enough for us.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was a historical inevitability.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN JAMES T.  KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens
have to cross before you believe it?

FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook
-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by
""chicken""? Could you define ""chicken"" please?

GEORGE BUSH
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed
the ""black man"" in order to trample him and keep him down.

Dear MAPP Transmission Providers and Customers,

On Wednesday, May 16th at 11:30pm CDT the MAPP OASIS NODE will be taken
off-line for approximately 1 hour for database maintenance.  At the same
time the latest version of OASIS software will be installed , v2.7.0d.

How does this effect MAPP Transmission Providers:

The new version of OASIS software allows for specific redirect service
types.  Two new option fields have been added to the service types, ""Allow
on Redirect"" and ""Account on Reduction"".

These two fields can be changed by selecting ""Transmission Services"" under
Provider Maintenance, and then click on the ID to update the transmission
service.

The ""Allow on Redirect"" option determines whether the service type appears
in the drop down box on the REDIRECT transmission request template.

The ""Account On Reduction"" determines whether REDIRECT request types appear
in the ""Query for Reductions"".

All services types will default to ""No"" for
the two new fields for existing transmission services.

Requirements:
Before the upgrade
1.  All ""Capacity Type"" entries must be unique for each transmission
provider.  Please change your ""Capacity Types"" so that they are unique.

 The ""Capacity Type"" will be changed by the MAPPCOR staff at the time of
upgrade if the unique ""Capacity Type"" for each provider is violated.

After the upgrade
1.  If you do have Redirect transmission service types then select ""Yes"" for
the ""Allow on Redirect"" field.

The MAPP OASIS Test node is available for testing version 2.7.0d.  The test
node can be accessed at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3

How does this effect MAPP Schedule F Customers:

MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers should select ""HNF Secondary"" as the
Service for redirecting a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm reservation as
Non-Firm.

In addition, to redirect a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm
reservation on Firm basis then one of the following services should be
selected ""FCTS Daily"", ""FCTS Weekly"", ""FCTS Monthly"", ""FCTS Seasonal"", ""FCTS
Yearly"", and ""FCTS Monthly 1 Month"" depending on the remaining duration.

Please try to have your business needs concluded prior to this outage.  We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have further
questions at 651.632.8508 or at transcoords@mapp.org.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle
  guards in Colorado.  Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed
  changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce
  Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could
respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman
Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they
be given six months of retraining.

  Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story,
pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the
teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy.

  ....And so it goes, in this election year.  Don't you just love the
smell of political napalm in the morning?  We are governed by a pack of
fools!






What is a Goron?


1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
    environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his
own
farm: a
    polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income
last
year.

2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is anti-smoking and
anti-tobacco
    when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted
government
    subsidies.

3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in
fact
he
    was placed by family influence in a ""cushy"" correspondent's job
and
the
    only action he saw was that of his Brownie camera!(and his bong)

4. Gorons actually believe that Al Gore is justified in illegally
raising
    political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt
    Law educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al Gore to accept large
sums
    of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had
taken
vows of
    poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to ""invent the
internet""
    would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of
    potentially incriminating e-mail!

7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the
    models for the book and movie, ""Love Story"" even though the
book's
author,
    Erich Segal, says that's a bunch of crap.

8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion
    against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars
in
    Occidental Petroleum stock.

9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's
    immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent
on
the
    subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton ""one of the
greatest
    Presidents of our history.""

  10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't
    bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
    ineffective that it has led to election of Republicans as BOTH
of
    Tennessee's senators.

  11. Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be
    the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he
served
to the
    poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum
    house that he was renting to them.


  Cautionary Note:Medical researchers acknowledge the Gorons are
generally
   harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately,
   overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to actually
vote
for
   Gore! They should be carefully protected from their ailment,
since
it
may
   be harmful to their well-being, yours, mine, and that of the USA.
   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out
to
aid
   the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and PLEASE pass this on to
your
   normal friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment."

As you are probably aware, if voting results in Florida stand as they
are now, George W. Bush will be our next President.
This will have catastrophic results in our vital  no, indispensable

entertainment industry. Barbra Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin  among many others  have sworn to leave
the country if George W. Bush is elected President.
And this is where YOU can help.  We need volunteers to help pack and
to
load moving vans.  We also need airfare for these irreplaceable national
treasures so they can relocate before they change their minds.
For the cost of a small SUV, you can sponsor one of these celebrities
and their unfortunate relocation.
You will know that your efforts are helping when you receive

letters and pictures from your chosen ""refugee"" as they learn to become a

You will help, won't you?  It costs so little but it means so much.

Tomorrow I am meeting with 2 separate consulting groups that represent collectively 15 EMCs in Georgia.  As a result of our calling efforts, it appears as if these 15 are some of the larger EMCs under Oglethorpe.  I think these 2 groups are planning to break apart from OPC and form 2 new agencies (7 in one, 8 in the other).  I plan to get as many details on this as possible during the meetings.

There are 2 opportunities at this point with specific EMCs in each of these groups.  Both are to buy energy on the Georgia ITS.  1) 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, and 2) 20MW, 7x24, 3-5 yrs., beginning 1/1/03, prefer load following at a 73% load factor, but will consider a block purchase.

I'm going to get more details on these separate requests, but wanted your initial interest level.

He spent some time to explain why his market is not tighter.  Basically, the underlying philosophy of their shop is to NOT jump into the new, less liquid markets until they develop further.  They would almost rather see a few markets develop within the region, with high liquidity in each market (as opposed to many markets in the region, with low liquidity in each market).  My response was to be part of developing many market in the region, all with high liquidity.  But, in order to do so and help all the players in the market, we need other participants.

All that being said, his offer is $4 for the Cal'02, into SOCO/on Ga-ITS spread, 5x16.  I'm going to try some of the others (Williams, Dyn, Mirant may be players).

I just met w/ New Smyrna.  They are interested in a parking deal.  They can probably only do up to 50MW, but they have done these deals in the past and are comfortable with how they work.  I will be back in Houston on Fri.  You can reach me at 713-503-2166 if you need anything.

I should receive the RFP shortly.  They are looking to sell a toll off of the plant.

As we discussed, TECO is offering up to 500MW (of a total 960MW) beginning 5/1/04 off the Gannon facility (which is being converted from coal to a gas-fired CC plant, called Bayside).  The plant is in Tampa, FL and the offering is unit-contingent.  

TECO prefers to sell a toll where we bring the gas, but is open to other proposals.  I figure we can bid for any of a few structures: 1) toll where we bring the gas, 2) toll indexed to a gas hub, where TECO is respons. for gas supply, 3) fixed price call.  

I think an at the money call would be the cleanest solution (avoid inefficiency's associated with the heat rate curve which varies by MW amount utilized, gas supply risk, etc.).

What is your preferred structure?  How many MW would you like to show a bid for?  Structuring ran an initial valuation for a 3-year, $35 daily call, 100MW.  Results are below.

A consultant (Energy Consulting Group) in Ga. representing an ""A-rated EMC"" is looking for 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, firm LD energy, ""on"" (not ""into"") the Ga-ITS (that is from any generation source on the ITS, or thru the interface and on the ITS).

From what I know about the Energy Consulting Group, they represent 8 of the larger EMC's in Ga.  We are going to meet with these guys in 2 weeks to see what deals they have available.  It looks like it may be a good opportunity for more short positions on the Ga-ITS.

Subject: Christmas Carol



There is one Christmas Carol that has always baffled me.

What in the world do leaping lords, French hens, swimming

swans, and especially the partridge who won't come our of

the pear tree have to do with Christmas?



Here is one explanation:



From 1558 until 1829, Roman Catholics in England were not

permitted to practice their faith openly.  Someone during

that era wrote this carol as a catechism song for young

Catholics.  It has two levels of meaning: the surface

meaning plus a hidden meaning known only to members of

their church. Each element in the carol has a code word

for a religious reality which the children could remember.



The partridge in a pear tree was Jesus Christ.



Two turtle doves were the Old and New Testaments.



Three French hens stood for faith, hope and love.



The four calling birds were the four gospels of

Matthew, Mark, Luke & John.



The five golden rings recalled the Torah or Law,

the first five books of the Old Testament.



The six geese a-laying stood for the six days of creation.



Seven swans a-swimming represented the sevenfold gifts of

the Holy SpiritProphesy, Serving, Teaching, Exhortation, Contribution,

Leadership, and Mercy.



The eight maids a-milking were the eight beatitudes.



Nine ladies dancing were the nine fruits of the Holy

SpiritLove, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness,

Faithfulness,Gentleness, and Self Control.



The ten lords a-leaping were the ten commandments.



The eleven pipers piping stood for the eleven faithful disciples.



The twelve drummers drumming symbolized the twelve

points of belief in the Apostles' Creed.



So there is your history for today, although I can't vouch

for its accuracy, but I found it an interesting possibility

I will be working with Doug Gilbert-Smith, who is the term trader in Ercot.    Good, solid technical guy.   These guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this,  I agreed to finish the rest of the year in Houston and get this thing up and running.    Ercot is currently not short nor volatile.    Not much fun yet, we'll see how the pool works.
I am working with Smith and Jeff Miller as well.

For all of its sound, fury and ego's the Houston office is actually disorganized and short on morale.    
My transition could have been handled better by a monkey man.      My gut tells me that if I stay with the company,  I will be moving back to Portland early next year if they will have me.

Let me know when you will be in town and I'll set up some golf and margaritas.   No boat anymore,  I'm bumming a ride with my friends.

Later,
JMF

Ben, as discussed,  please move the four Ercot lines to the front page for the listed people below.       Also,  to the extent possible,   add the E lines.

These guys are prioritized as follows:

Hey Lloyd,
As you know,  Joe and Steve spent a considerable amount of time here last weekend due to the flood.     I would think that some recognition would be in order.

How about a personal best of $500,  or a gift certificate,  etc.?     

What do you think?

Duong,

Can I get a change in Enpower?   We have done this type thing on the West desk:

For every counterparty ""Ercot Imbalance"" ,   I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to ""off""  automatically.     When this manual process does not get done,  we have settlement problems.

What do you think?

JForney"

Samuel,
The traders listed above are not valid in Enpower as traders under the following books:

Ercot Hourly
Teco Services


Please have them added asap,  or if you could,  let me know who is responsible for making this change.


Thanks Samuel,

JMF
"
m..forney@enron.com,"

The Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed.
This is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.

Let me know what you have.

For all that have missed the floor meeting,   we have been downgraded to ""junk"" status,  ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price.
A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.     Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least.   
If bankruptcy is filed,  payroll should be covered.
Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.   There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.

Currently,  we are not trading.    We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.    Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.    We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.

More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.     Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.   We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.

JMF  
"
m..forney@enron.com,"


We must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.  
 For example,   when we have availability,    or even ""must sell""  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem. 

They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.    


For now,  you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.     Of course,  you can just knock on the door.
In Ercot only,   we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.    No other region has this capability.


Thanks,
JMForney

Hey,  
what's the latest in the service world?     I am working with Tom May on services in Ercot in addition to my Ercot ISO duties.

During the month of September and October 2000, gas flowed into HPL's 
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by Duke Energy Trading and 
Marketing, LLC.  Prior to September 2000, the gas was purchased under 
contract #960439646, and Deal #133196 that expired on 8/31/2000.  Effective 
11/1/2000, the gas was again purchased from Duke under Contract #96021934; 
Deal #466305, but this deal expires on 11/30/2000. 

Currently, Logistic has September and October 2000 volumes recorded to HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either 
(1) Deals #133196 or #466305 extended to cover September and October 2000, 
(2) a new deal to cover September and October 2000, or (3) Logistics needs 
approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.  (Print,

In addition,  since Deal #466305 expires on 11/30/2000 and gas is still 
flowing, Logistics needs either (1) Deal #466305 extended, or (2) a new deal 
to cover December 2000 and any other future months that this production is 
flowing into HPL's pipeline.

This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed 
volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892  
today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at 
meter #980439.

Daren:

This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should 
clear within 24 to 48 hours.

Victor:

This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes 
for you.

Well, I figured you could use a joke after dealing with your trader (read

your life is a tad more pleasant.  The movie is playing a regular intervals 
(7:30, 8 & 9) so that should give us some flexibility in getting some food

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

For background purposes, UI has a 17.5% ownership interest in the Seabrook 
nuclear facility (total facility is 1142 MW).   The other owners of Seabrook 
are as follows:
  Northeast Utilities 40% (they are driving the sale - it is a condition on 
their Con-Ed merger)
  Great Bay Power  12% (they have announced their intention on selling)
  New England Power 10%
  Other minority owners 20% (8 small minority municipal & IOU owners)

The Seabrook facility has been on the auction block for the past 6-9 months, 
and given the uncertainty of the timing of the sale, Dana & I felt it was 
imprudent to book calender year 2001 until we knew with certainty that the 
plant asset transfer (and associated state, NRC and FERC approvals) would 
occur after 2002.  Remember contractually, EPMI's 200 MW PPA position 
terminates upon final closure of a UI sale of its 17% interest.   With 
respect to Millstone, Pilgrim and Maine Yankee nuclear asset sales, the 
majority owner drives the sale process and minority owners generally almost 
always sell their interest at the same price as the majority owner.   With 
respect to UI's 17.5%  interest in Seabrook, UI has already informed us they 
intend on selling their interest along with the majority owner.

Obviously, the plant has not yet been sold and I feel comfortable (given a 
10-12 month approval process coupled with Seabrook's politically sensitive 
location in New Hampshire) booking the 200 MW position through 2001.

ICAP P&L
Given the huge regulatory uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of ICAP 
in NE,  Dana is uncomfortable taking any of the $55 million to income at this 
time.   Basically, our opinion is that the regulatory decision will either 
result in a default price of $0.50-1.00/kW/Mo (resulting in approx $20-30 
million postive P&L) or a default price of $3-3.50/kW/Mo (loss of $20-30 
million).

The ICAP decision has once again been removed from the FERC agenda for next 
Wednesday's meeting.   This is the 3rd time that has happened in the past 2 
months and indicates a lack of consensus at FERC.   Given this FERC 
indecisiveness and the current situation in California and reliability issues 
in both the Western and Eastern US in general,  I am very concerned that FERC 
does not have the political guts to pull the plug on ICAP (or lower the 
default price to low penalty rate).

Given this regulatory situation, there is a 50/50 chance we lose additional 
money and a 50/50 chance we make additional money.   Said another way, we 
would likely use the entire $55 million in ICAP $'s to completely hedge ICAP 
through the term of UI.

In addiiton, there was a FERC ruling regarding PJM ICAP today that said 
$4.00+/kW/Mo for PJM ICAP was indeed market based and not market 
manipulated.  This coupled with FERC's lack of decision for 3+ months on NE 
ICAP makes us very uncomfortable.   The good news is we are not short PJM 
ICAP.

1)  Monetize $20 million of the 2001 accrual gas position to be utilized for 
the following Schedule C prudency accounts:

$10 million against the JEA (Northern Florida) short position (170,000 MWh's 
on-peak).   We have mid-marketers attempting to buy energy for 01 and 02 in 
FL, however, the market is extremely tight with no competitive offers.   The 
JEA position is covered with FPL non-firm power, therefore, we are exposed to 
on-peak price volatility due to FPL economic curtailment during load 
management periods.
$3 million against the VEPCO market-based call option with a look back audit 
on pricing.  This deal is an absolute pain in the ass because we are forced 
to quote a price to VEPCO that is representative of an actual transaction at 
reasonable prices with a rationale counterparty in the SE market.  They can 
call on the MW daily, weekly, or monthly.   We can lose as much as $2-3 
million/yr on this BS position due to the logistical issues and look back 
audit rights that VEPCO has.
$2 million against the MJMUC (inside Associated Electric Coop) 40 MW 7x24 
short position in a transmission constrained market area with absolutely no 
liquidity.  We have this position marked against the Entergy curves, however, 
physical delivery is a major issue which creates curtailment (and LD$) 
uncertainty.
$5 million against the OPPD 110 MW daily shaped call (with hourly 
flexibility) that is nearly impossible to hedge cleanly.   OPPD is in 
Southern MAPP (Nebraska) and delivery risks are significant.  The total deal 
is in our books at negative $25 million (10/2/00 curves) and we potentially 
have an additional $5 million of exposure due to illiquid nature of MAPP, 
scalar risk, and physical delivery risk.

We have several other customer deals that have hair, however, they are 
generally more manageable from a physical delivery standpoint.   Each of the 
deals above are in illiquid markets with delivery problems and scheduling 
flexibility for the counterparty that is incosistent with the current power 
trading market.   For these generic reasons and the specific issues outlined 
above, I am recommending Schedule C prudency for the amounts indicated 
above.  
From my standpoint, it is prudent and appropriate to use $20 million from gas 
accrual gains to finance these prudency positions.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks."

 RESCO PPA (outages not booked properly) - $8 million
 Congestion & Ancillary Assumptions  - $8-10 million
 Millstone nuclear option ($32/Mwh option) - $5-6 million  (With sale of 
Millstone, this option goes away)

The $32/Mwh Seabrook nuclear plant daily option was not modeled for 01-03 
because the sale of Seabrook (expected to occur earlier this year) is an 
automatic termination of the $32/Mwh option, therefore the value was not 
booked.  Since the sale of Seabrook sale has not occured yet and a minimum of 
10 months is required to get state & local, NRC and FERC approvals for the 
sale of Seabrook, we have a positive value surprise to the tune of $10-12 
million (assuming option is booked through 9/01.

Let me know if you want us to take the value for 4th quarter or wait until 
next year to take the income.    Since we have a pact to not hide anything, I 
wanted to make you aware of this situation.

The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets 
with a ""real supply curve"" and a ""real demand curve"" such that hourly 
clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   With 
respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is 
necessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal model 
for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in 
the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time 
energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing 
is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in 
zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.

Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make 
some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonal 
markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a 
mis-priced commodity with no ""real"" price signal sent to the market.   Out of 
merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion 
is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not 
sent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity market 
where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity 
or transportation on a forward basis.

I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding."

Buying a call spread option for a SJ to Cal Border spread for Calendar 2002 
and 2003 at a strike price of $3.90 (spread exceeds $3.90)
-That was priced at $0.25 for 2002 and $0.20 for 2003.

Selling a put spread option, SJ to Cal Border in the same time frames at a 
strike price of $0.10 (spread drops below $0.10)

I have heard through the grape vine that concerns were raised this morning at your staff meeting about the Allegheny closing.  Just to clarify, we have set May 3, 2001 as the closing date.  On that date we should receive $1,028,000.00 plus $10-15 million for reimbursement of some cost associated with a build out of a sub station. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just wanted to give you the a quick update on TIL.  GE is coming out to install Rev4 on Monday (see details below).  

As we discussed earlier today, Rev2 was installed at Caledonia in December, soon after signing PSA with Cinergy.  Rev4 is now out and available.  If we decide to run, we need Rev4.  GE called today to say that the tech is coming to Caledonia on Monday to install Rev4 (or if we delay, it will be two weeks).  Obviously we can't wait two weeks.  As required in the PSA, I called Cinergy (David Tang) to tell him that we are installing Rev4 on Monday and Tuesday and if they want to send someone to the plant to witness the control curve changes, to send someone out on Tuesday (GE's recommendation).  We will also have Ross Newlin from OEC at the plant.

In addition, we confirmed with Michelle April (GE Rep) today that we are still operating under the original TIL issued back in December (which you have a copy of).

Let me know if you need anything else.

I will get you comments by close of business today.  Assuming the announcement goes out this week, Stuart will not be part of it.  He will be out Thursday and Friday and has requested that he have until Monday to make up his mind.

Straw Man announcement - please pad out.

We are pleased to announce Don Miller will be joining Enron Americas with the responsibility for heading up a new group within the organisation.  The Business Development group will have responsibility for the divestment function within Enron Americas and work with the Generation Investments Group on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power origination funding requirements with Treasury.   Don will report directly to the Office of the Chair, Enron Americas.

Joining Don as Commercial Director in this group will be Stuart Sizman who has most recently been working with Don on the divestment of our five peaking plants.  

Please join us in congratulating Don and Stuart on their new roles.

Allegheny is no bid on New Albany.  They want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion.  The turbines at New Albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion.

They are interested in pursuing our Longview development in Washington, and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in Entergy.

It looks like I might really have to work at selling New Albany!!!

Quick follow-up on Allegheny, just in case you get a call today.  I have come to learn that Peter Skrgic is now the former President of Allegheny Energy Supply, having just retired in the last month.  He has been replaced by Mike Morrell, who is also the CFO, until someone can be found to replace him.  Morrell should be very familiar with Allegheny's financing plan for these assets. 

To the extent that you want to pass the detailed financing conversation on to me, I am more than happy to have that conversation with Morrell. Also, just so you know, apparently Goldman is going to be the lead banker on the equity offering.  

Let me know if you hear anything or have any questions.

Thanks,

Will you please have someone re-send the confirmation to Dynegy Canada for May 25th and May 31st.  The sitara ticket Number is 761773.  

I trade on a daily basis with Dynegy Canada and I use them to balance on (a good deal for Enron), so their volumes may change several times during the morning trading period.  So as a result, to avoid sending them duplicate confirmations, would it be possible to wait until the afternoon to send their daily confirmations?

If not, no big deal, it would just make less work for everyone concerned.

Attached below is the Excel-based VaR Calculator that allows VaR calculations 
for up to 5 different curves and/or products. The results may be different 
that those generated in the ""official"" VaR model, because it does not reflect 
all the intricacies. We have developed an Ad-hoc VaR model that allows quick 
calculations of VaR for a potential transaction, as well as the incremental 
VaR on a given portfolio (using the ""official"" VaR model). We will make this 
tool available to you via http://rac.enron.com/ in the near future (pending 
IT implementation).

I may be wrong, but trying to follow the press and Houston-originated 
e-mails, I am under the impression that FERC has issued an order finding that 
California prices were NOT unjust and unreasonable, and that generators did 
NOT abuse marketpower in recent price setting exercise, and that there may be 
a California PUC order relevant to the recent price flare up.  Any way, as 
Jeff will know, a UK academic is going to be presenting in Berkley and Tokyo 
later this month, arguing that hogan and Joskow are wrong about the value of 
retail competition, and he expressed an interest in being current on recent 
agency pronouncements.  To make this long story shorter, are there 
citations/references to such orders that I could provide to the good 
Professor (admittedly doing a bit of his work for him, but hopefully by being 
current his message will be more on)?  If yes, can I get the FERC cites (and 
web reference) from Joe or Sarah, and any California PUC order citation (and 
web reference) from Jeff?   many thanks  mcs

		 Subject: SoCalEd Petition for a Writ of Mandamus

On December 26, SoCalEd filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus against FERC 
regarding FERC's December 15 order, asking the Court of Appeals for the D.C. 
Circuit to direct FERC to establish and order ""just and reasonable cost-based 
rates"" for sales in the California ISO and PX markets.  SoCal requests that 
the Court act by January 5.

SoCal argues that its lenders have said that unless FERC acts immediately to 
""restore creditor confidence"" in SoCal's ability to repay its loans, that 
SoCal will not be able to access additional funding, so that by mid-January 
SoCal will be unable to buy electricity, resulting in rolling blackouts to 
its customers.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like a faxed copy of 
the petition.

Also, Scott Miller called Julie today and told her that FERC is feeling

would like to hear positive responses from market participants at the meeting

temper our comments and recognize and praise FERC for the bold action it took 
in the order (on things like governance, buy/sell requirement, etc.) in 
addition to raising our concerns about the price mitigation measures.

		 Subject: FERC Meeting on Northeast RTO

FERC held its meeting today.  Big things happened.

Northeast

FERC approves PJM conditionally as the RTO ""platform"" to be used to form one 
RTO in the northeast.  FERC rejects the New York and New England RTO 
proposals and directs the three ISOs and all interested parties to 
participate in a mediation led by a FERC Settlement Judge with assistance 
from outside consultants.  The purpose of the mediation proceeding is to 
facilitate the formation of a single RTO in the Northeast.  The mediation 
must begin within one week from today and must conclude 45 days thereafter.  
The Judge must then submit a report to the Commission 10 days thereafter, 
which will include an outline of the proposal to create a single northeast 
RTO, milestones for the completion of intermediate steps, and a deadline for 
submitting a joint proposal.

While the Commission has not formally extended the RTO implementation date 
(currently December 15, 2001), Chairman Hebert made comments a couple of 
weeks ago and again today that perhaps the December 15, 2001 may have to slip 
some.  We will continue to monitor this issue.

Donna Fulton is sending separately a write up of similar action the 
Commission took with regard to the Southeast RTO effort.  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments.

? The two main points of contention between SB 78XX and AB 82XX appear to be 
the renewables portfolio (SB 78XX's version is thought of as more reasonable) 
and the provisions for a PUC reasonableness review of the long-term 
contracts.  SB 82XX prohibits a reasonableness review, and SoCal is pushing 
for this language to be incorporated into SB 78XX.  This language was also in 
the original MOU between SoCal and the governor."
kristin.walsh@enron.com,"

QF/Generator undercollect may be an invitation to involuntary bankruptcy
As reported last week, QF has sitting and waiting to hear what the CAPUC has 
to say, unfortunately it may not be what the QFs want to hear.  The 
utilities' undercollect, which will not be addressed in today's CAPUC 
hearings, could very well provide an invitation for QFs and generators to 
file involuntary bankruptcy against SoCal and PG&E.  Recent rate hikes 
proposed by the CAPUC specifically dictate that any revenue generated from 
rate increases cannot be used to pay off utility past debt, leaving the QF 
with little hope of recovery.  QFs were obviously dismayed by the CAPUC's 
draft order and if the decision is passed as it currently reads, an 
involuntary bankruptcy filing is still likely.

CAPUC holds rate increase hearings today
As reported yesterday, Loretta Lynch released the details of the CAPUC's 
draft rate increase order last night.  There is expected to be a 3 cent/kwh 
surcharge on power bills or roughly a 40% rate increase.  A portion of this 
""surcharge"" will be given to the DWR to cover its costs and the order 
concludes that utilities need revenues on a going-forward basis.  Therefore, 
utilities can only use the revenues for power purchases going forward and are 
expressly forbidden from using this cash to pay down past debt (ex. QFs).  
However, the utilities are ordered to resume payments to the QFs on a 
going-forward basis.  The net effect of the order is to allow the utilities 
to operate in case of bankruptcy.

One interesting point in the draft is its decision which calls on the 
utilities to join  with the state in pursuing a refund on the amount 
overcharged for power by the generators.  The suggestion is that the 
utilities take legal action against the generators to recoup funds.  Only the 
funds recovered from generators can be used to pay down the utilities' past 
debt.  If the utilities choose this course of action, it would be a very 
lengthy process.
  
Davis contends with Lynch on CAPUC rate increases.
Davis has thus far refused to support CAPUC's proposed rate increase stating 
the CAPUC decision making board is an independent body and that he continues 
to believe that a resolution can be found within the current rate structure.  
Sources indicate that he is likely to ask for Lynch's letter of resignation, 
however, there is no indication she will comply.  Senator Burton, who 
supports the CAPUC's plan, reportedly will protect Lynch by not allowing her 
to be impeached (which is the only other way she could be removed by the 
governor)."
kristin.walsh@enron.com,"

? The deal may be enough to save Socal from bankruptcy.  This will depend on 
the payment terms as well as how soon Socal can receive a positive cash flow.
? We are not sure if the State can really do a deal without PG&E or a deal 
for whole grid.  It was thought that a transmission asset deal was not 
possible without PG&E.  This may still be the case; the state may still be 
making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of PG&E's assets.  A generator 
source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy 
court to close the deal on PG&E's lines quickly.  However, bankruptcy courts 
usually do not operate in this manner.  In most cases the court would have to 
hold open proceedings, have competitive bids, etc.
? This purchase would need legislative approval, which is not guaranteed.  
Previously the plan was for the state to purchase SCE's and PG&E's assets at 
a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the 
utilities would be able to buy power for themselves.  Now they would have to 
purchase SCE's lines, but still finance power purchases because of PG&E.  
Additionally, it is possible that Socal swapped the clause allowing then to 
raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book 
price.  If this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain 
legislative approval.
? The purchase would also need FERC approval.  As stated before, if FERC 
approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for California."
kristin.walsh@enron.com,"

? Hertzberg and Keeley had a press conference today at 1:30 PST.  Questions 
included the impact of today's ruling and how it would affect Plan B, 
Hertzberg replied he was not sure.    He also indicated that they support the 
Feinstein bill and if the lawsuit or the rehearing efforts do not work, 
legislation is the last chance for price caps.  Hertzberg also indicated that 
he was getting to the point where CA ""may just say no to prices that are too 
high"" (via buyer cartel).

kristin.walsh@enron.com,"

Another bill is currently being drafted by Assemblyman Keeley and Sen. Battin 
allowing QFs to sell electricity at 8 cents per kilowatt hour (down from 18 
cents) to Socal.  The bill stemmed from a series of negotiations that have 
been taking place with CA government officials.  However, a source close to 
the negotiations confirms that  PG&E was not involved in the meetings. 

Per Friday's update, negotiations continue on a bond issuance plan but sides 
remain divided on amount and if it would include the internal debt of the 
parent companies or just debt due to external creditors."
kristin.walsh@enron.com,"

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California 
Assembly.  The bill would pass with a simple majority as a non-urgency bill, 
meaning the bill would not take effect for 90 days.  The state would be 
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute 
financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) 
Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem now will be the 
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission 
line purchase or other assistance."

Municipal Power is Politically Attractive
There is growing pressure across California for cities to consider forming 
their own municipal power companies. Community leaders across the state are 
enviously eyeing the success of Sacramento's SMUD utility and the Los Angeles 
Municipal Power Utility, where rate hikes and service disruptions have been 
far less pronounced than the rest of the state. Several leaders in San 
Francisco are considering setting up their own power company, and another two 
dozen cities are also contemplating action. Municipal power companies are not 
subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission, and 
could therefore sidestep the current proposed structure of rate hikes. 

Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will 
be extremely difficult, as it runs against some of the most entrenched and 
long-standing privileges in California politics. Under California law, it is 
very difficult to stop many cities from doing what they feel is in their best 
interest. Most older and larger cities are ""charter cities"" rather than 
""general law cities"" subject to the California Municipal code. Under the 
California Constitution, charter cities can pretty much do anything or 
provide any service short of printing money and raising an army.  The League 
of California cities - a weighty organization representing every one of 
California's cities - is already swinging into action to support direct 
access. Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councilors and have some 
sympathy with local independence. And the resistance within the Assembly is 
already building against Hertzberg's attempts to stop even large companies 
getting direct access. 

Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state 
legislature on the issue. But if municipalities do not opt out, they may have 
to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more 
for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power 
company. Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major 
employers. Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies 
stand to gain or lose a fortune on this matter, and this could affect 
campaign contributions. 

State Power Plans at Risk
If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies, it could 
undermine at least three key elements of the State of California's power 
plans: 
? First, the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other 
large users. But municipal power would unpick this structure, allow large 
regions of California to ignore the PUC, leaving the rate structure to be 
determined city by city. Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure 
from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes. 
Others might cave into irate voters.
? Second, the plans laid out by Governor Davis' and State Treasurer 
Angelides' for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly 
damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it.  It is possible 
that long-term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if 
municipalities opt out of higher long-term rates by buying on the open 
market.  It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have 
to sell at a loss.
? Third, revenues to back the proposed power bond could be imperiled, if 
municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to 
repay the bond. And if the momentum for direct access develops among the 
cities and municipalities across the state, it could make it much more 
difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright 
at potential threats to the viability of repayments. 
The issue is at an early stage  the PUC had a general workshop on the 
matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday.  State legislative leaders 
are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal 
secession, or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully 
away. But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path 
could prove to be difficult. "
kristin.walsh@enron.com,"

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer.

ENA Gas Assets Group Outing

You have between now and June 6th to practice and get ready.  It's time to 
get in touch with you inner bowler.  That's right, we are going bowling!!!!  
Tuesday, June 6th all of Gas Assets, everyone under Brenda's direction, will 
be going Bowling.  We will depart the Enron building between 2:45 and 3:15 on 
buses (no not the yellow kind) and we head for Dynamic Lanes, where everyone 
will be placed on a team of 4, bowl three games, compete and cheat (just 
joking) for fabulous prizes and then return to the Enron building around 6:00 
pm, just in time to catch buses and go home.

FAQ
Is it mandatory that I go?

No, BUT you will be gravely missed if you are not there, you will be left out 
of all the inside jokes that are sure to come as a result of this event, and 
you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers for not attending.


 If I don't go bowling can I leave work / stop working at 2:45. ?

No.

If I do go does that mean I do not have to return to work to complete 
required daily tasks such as P&L?

No."

Subject: Prayer Requests from Wednesday November 8


Here are the prayer requests from Wednesday and I have added several emailed
prayer requests forwarded to me this week.  There are so many hurting
people.  It is great to know the Great Physician, isn't it?!!!

Sorry so late.  I pray that you will remember this one thing:

""I am your refuge and your strength.  Even though the earth gives way and
the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, do not fear.  I am an ever
present help in trouble.""
Psalm 46:1-3

Attached are the prayer requests for Wednesday, November 15.  Also,
following is a follow-up to a question about The Lord's Prayer and what
Jesus meant when He said ""Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil"".  Mary Rios, thank you for asking.  It has been a rewarding study as I
have searched the Word, Strong's and other resources and it is beautiful.
First, here is an insert from what Eloise, our dear sister that comes to the
Bible Study on Wednesday's with Pat McFarland has to offer.  I asked her to
write it down for us as a remind:

Carol,

Thank you so much for your prayers.  I did get your message and here is
the verse of the Lord's Prayer, we tallked about  in class.  The
Spanish  version is ""No, los dejes caer ententacion"", interpreted as
""No, Let us not fall into temptation.""  Or it can be ""No, lead us not
into temptation.""  Either one is asking in prayer for our Lord Savior to
help in the choices we are faced with daily and many times there are
temptations.

Carol, the word Lead, I believe is problably what has confused the
lady in class and maybe the word Let might also, but we need to look at
the total verse.  I honestly believe the articulation in much of the
material we process sometimes needs to be looked at closely for precise
meaning.  I believe that in praying and asking for our Lord Jesus to
discern what is really meant, this is my answer.
-
Here is what I feel explains it as well:

When Jesus commanded us to pray ""Lead us not into temptation"" He was
instructing believers to pray that forces beyond their own control would not
lead them into trials (see Matt 24:20, Revelation 3:10).  ;He is also
commanding believers to watch and pray against entering into temptation
through their own carelessness or disobedience (Matt 26:41, Luke 21:34; Luke
22:40, 46).

Jesus had warned Peter;  ""Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have
you, that he may sift you as wheat"" (Luke 22:31).  Knowing Satan's plans,
Jesus cautioned Peter to watch and pray lest he enter into temptation.  This
indicates that if Pete would have listened to Jesus, he would have remained
strong.

Jesus also knows our potential weaknesses.  He remembers we are dust (Ps
103:14).  He knows our human spirits may be willing, but our flesh is weak.
He realizes that we can give in to temptation as a result of our own
carelessness and disobedience, and Jesus knows of forces can circumstances
beyond our control that can come to try us.  Therefore, He lovingly commands
us to pray ""Lead us not into temptation"".

Jesus will not lead us there.  When we pray for His leadership, He leads us
away from it.  According to Strong's it is asking Him to make us strong and
be our guide.

There is more to it than only that which we can get into, and should most
definitely, later.

Have a safe, blessed Holiday and know I will be praying for all of you.  See
you next on Wednesday, November 29th when Juan Barba's wonderful Godly
mother will minister to us from a mother's heart.

God Bless you...Carol

Subject: Prayer Requests for Wednesday, December 6 Bible Study


Following are the prayer requests and in case someone did not get it, the
story of the Christmas Tree.

Hope to see you all next Wednesday as we look at the Fruit of Spirit:
Peace.  Peace in the midst of storms.  Peace when there is not outward
reason for it.  Peace when it seems your world is falling apart.  That peace
that passes ALL understanding.

 <<prayer requests for December 6.xls>>  <<FOCUSING ON THE REASON FOR THE
SEASON.doc>>

Dear Heavenly Father:

Thank You once again for Your Word and Your Love.  So many will be traveling
this Christmas season, we ask for that ""hedge of protection"" that ""canopy of
Divine Love and Protection"" over each of us, our families, our loved ones.

Jesus, help us to be an even brighter light for You this year.  For our
loved ones - that husband, daughter, son, brother, sister, dear friend,
wife, parent - Lord, open their eyes to see You and to see their need for
You.  Show them that they really do not have to try to make it on their own.
You so long to help them.  But they push You away.  You are so patient and
loving.  Help us to be Your Hands that reach out to them, Your arms of love
that wrap around them.  Your ears to hear what they are NOT saying.  Eyes to
see through the mask of coldness, indifference, anger, insecurity, false
bravado, or whatever has been built up around their hearts.  Send Your
laborers across their paths to show them the way to You.  Direct our words
so that we will speak words of life and hope and healing.  Let us be Your
peace in the midst of the hustle and bustle.  A calm when everyone is
running crazy.

Father, for LaShanda and her precious baby - direct their steps and hold
them close to Your heart.  For Angie Wingo and Stephanie Cole and Pat
McFarland's niece, give these women a safe and easy delivery.  Above all,
healthy babies, anointed by You and Chosen from the foundation of the earth
to be born at this time.  Keep Your hand upon them Father and give these
women Your peace.

For Juan's dear brother and Josie Wicks' job search and Mary Rios' continued
employment - Lord, You know each situation and You will be their source and
supply.  Help Juan's brother be a light at Channel 22 as he goes about his
day.

Father for LaShanda's brother, Rita Ramirez' son Jose, Eloise's brother and
mother, Anita - these are suffering from depression.  This is not from You.
You give us a spirit of love, and peace and a sound mind.  We ask for Your
peace to cover these precious ones.  For LaShanda's brother and Jose, left
this be a time that You will work amazing creative miracles in their hearts.
We are so proud of Jose and love hearing how You have lifted out of the pit
he was descending.  Do the same for LaShanda's brother.  Show he the way to
You.

There are so many who do not know You Lord.  Mary Kay's husband and sweet
daughter, Doug, Duncan, Bruce and so many others who are near and dear to
our hearts - touch these lives Lord.  Make them Your own, Father.

Lord for this situation in Melissa's family.  You know all about it.  We
lift it up to You and ask that You make a clear and open path for
forgiveness, healing, peace and remove that stress that is weighing so
heavily upon her mother.

These addictive bondages that Angie Collins' sister is trapped with - set
her free according to Your Word.  Surround her with believers who will stand
with her and encourage her and help her when she is at her weakest.

Lord, there are so many other requests that we get daily.  It can be
overwhelming - all the hurt and sorrow and pain and sickness and disease.
All those with financial burdens and marriages that are on the brink of
disaster.  Children running from all You have to give.  Lord, we ask for
Your guidance, Your strength, Your protection.  Heal the hurt, Father, and
use us.  Use us to be You in a hurting world.  Use us and continue to mold
us into Your image.  Help us to stay focused on You and not get distracted.

In Jesus' Name...Amen

Subject: Unit Contingent Deals  

I spoke with Les about these deals, and he told me he'd like unit contingent 
SALES confirmed, and unit contingent BUYS not confirmed. I sorted through 
these deal numbers and changed the buys to not be confirmed, and it looks 
like most of the sales already have the unit name in the comments section. 
Following is the list of deals you sent me and notes on what I did:

562211 - changed to ""no confirm""
564613 - changed to ""no confirm""
566060 - unit name is in comments section
566062 - unit name is in comments section
566069 - unit name is in comments section
566071 - unit name is in comments section
566077 - unit is Willamette Albany Paper Mill/comments section is full - ???
566078 - unit name is in comments section
556116 - unit is LV Cogen/added to comments
554737 - unit is LV Cogen/added to comments

Les and I also talked about creating a master list of delivery points and 
their respective unit names for future reference. Please let me know if you 
think that would be helpful. In the meantime, feel free to send these lists 
to me.

Thanks,

582322 - Las Vegas Cogeneration

I've added the unit names to the deals and reminded Les that they need to be 
in the comments section. He was under the impression that the guideline sheet 
he sent out re: unit names spelled out the answers, but I took another look 
at it and it doesn't seem to really answer anything. I've attached it just in 
case you don't have it anymore - but please let me know if this assists you 
guys in ANY way. If it doesn't, I can probably get him to draw up something 
more useful.

Subject: Deal Changes - No Confirm

Kim - 
I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please 
let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I 
still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. 
On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the 
following deals:

557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?
552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?

And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so 
you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be 
confirmed.


Diana - 
I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General 
Electric, but before I change the following deals to ""no confirm"" I want to 
clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.
 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, 
Montana System, etc.), do we confirm?
 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is 
Portland General System, do we confirm?
 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General 
System, do we confirm? 
I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals 
in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that 
I'm doing this right. Please let me know.

I have begun to document all special situations and counterparties that are 
exceptions to our ""not to be confirmed"" rules.  Thus, in the future, when we 
need to answer questions regarding why certain deals are unconfirmed, there 
will be no confusion about where the directives not to do so originated.

Please review this document carefully.  Go ahead and make any changes that 
you'd like -but please change your font color so that I will know which items 
you have added.  I will incorporate all of your edits to the master document 
and save it to a common drive where it can be accessed and updated whenever 
necessary.

If you can think of any additional ""not to be confirmed"" 
exceptions/situations, or more specific details  -please add them.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.

Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names

She didn't ""warn"" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

I just received this from my friend. I don't remember who I sent the prayer
request to for the couple having a baby. I thank you for your prayers
though. It is amazing how God will be glorified through this situation.
Kristy


Hey guys -

Thanks for  all the prayers for Toby and Cindy.  Cindy had the baby on
Tuesday and as of last night, Thursday, he was doing well.  He does have
anencephaly.  The back part of his skull is not formed and they don't
know how long he will live.  They are still in the hospital and will probably
remain there.  Toby and Cindy are doing really well and the baby has
touched many lives in the few days he has been here.  His name is Ian 
Christian.
He weighed 5 lbs. 15 ounces and I'm not sure of the length.  I guess nurses
have been coming in wanting to see him and many have cried.  Ian's
pediatrician, which she is from India, asked Toby and Cindy about their
faith because they are doing so well.

My husband and I were talking about this last night and I can't even
imagine going through this; but what about those people that don't know 
Christ as their Personal Savior.  How would they ever get through it?

I'll keep you all up to date.  Toby and Cindy told Ian that he could go
be with Jesus, but as of last night he's still here.  God must still have
some more lives for him to touch before he goes Home.

Keep them in your prayers and thanks for all the prayers, I know they
feel them.

Love to you all - Molly

 ?A man's daughter  had asked the local minister to come and pray 
  with her father.  When the minister arrived, he found the man lying 
  in bed with his head propped up on two pillows.  An empty chair 
  sat beside his bed.  The minister assumed that the old fellow had 
  been informed of his visit. ""I ?guess you were expecting me,""  he said. 
 ? 
 ?""No, who are you?""  said the father. 
 ? 
 ?The minister told him his name and then remarked, ""I see the empty 
  chair; I figured you knew I was going to show up."" 
 ? 
 ?""Oh yeah, the chair,""  said the bedridden man. ""Would you mind closing 
  the door?""  Puzzled, the minister ?shut the door. ""I have never told anyone 
  this, not even my daughter,"" said the man. ""But all of  my life I have 
 ?never ?known how to pray.   At church I used  to hear the pastor 
 ?talk about prayer, but it went right over my  head.  I abandoned 
 ?any attempt at prayer,"" the old man continued, ""until one day about 
 ?four years ago my best friend said to me, 'Johnny, prayer is just 
 ?a simple matter of having a  conversation with Jesus.  Here is what 
 ?I suggest.  ""Sit down in a chair; place an empty chair in front of 
 ?you, and in faith see Jesus on the chair.   It's not spooky because he 
 ?promised, ""I'll  be with you always."" Then just speak to him in the 
 ?same way  you're doing with me right now.' ""So, I tried it and I've liked it
 ?so much that I do it a couple of hours every day.  I'm careful though. 
 ?If my daughter saw me talking to an empty chair, she'd either 
 ?have a nervous breakdown or send me off to the funny farm."" 
 ? 
 ?The minister was deeply moved by the story and encouraged the 
  old man to continue on the  journey.  ?Then he prayed with him, 
  anointed him with oil, and  returned to the church. Two nights later 
  the daughter called to  tell the minister  that her daddy had died 
  that afternoon. 

  ""Did  he die in peace?"" he asked. 
 
 ?""Yes, when I  left the house about two o' clock, he called me over to 
  his  bedside, told me he loved me and kissed me on the cheek.   
  When I  got back from the store an hour later, I found him dead. 
  ""But there was something strange about his death. Apparently, 
  just  before Daddy died, he leaned over and rested his head on 
  the chair beside the bed. What do you make of ?that?"" 
  ? 
 ?The minister wiped a tear from his eye and said,  ""I wish we could all go 
like that."" 
 ? 
 ?Just ?send this to  four people and do not break this, please. Prayer is 
  one of the  best free gifts we receive. There is no cost but a lot of  
rewards.

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to ""make pancakes,"" for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

So the man yelled ""God speak to me"" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, ""God let me see you."" And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, ""God show me a miracle"" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, ""Touch me God, and let me know you are
here"" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed. 
"
darlene.forsyth@enron.com,"

Take 60 seconds & give this a shot! Let's just see if Satan stops this one.

All you do is -

1) Simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this, (Father God, 
bless this person in whatever it is that You know he or she may be needing 
this day!)

2)Then send it on to five other people.

Within hours five people have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of 
people to pray to God for other people. Then sit back and watch the power of 
God work in your life for doing the thing that you know He loves.

Please send it back to me, so that I can also pray for you!!!"

Subject: Your Friend

Darlene,
I have a friend in my Sunday School class who is the Josten's distributor 
here in Dallas. This is the company that makes class rings. He will sell me a 
class ring at cost! (How 'bout that?) So, if you will get the info from your 
friend about her daughter (ring size, school, name, etc) I will get her a 
ring. I don't know that I can afford gold, but I can silver, if that is ok. 
If we want gold, we could maybe pool some money. The cost of a gold ring is 
$175 vs $75 for silver. Anyway, just let me know as soon as you can so that I 
can get it ordered. I'm not sure on the delivery time, but we do need to get 
moving on it so that she can enjoy it before the school year is over.
 
Blessings!

You see, I am one of those very fortunate people who, until a few years ago, 
had perfect 20/20 vision.
As we who are over 40 very well know, you start to lose your ""good eyes"" and 
must resort to eye glasses or contacts.  Well, after several years of 
fighting with the glasses, losing them, sitting on them, etc., etc., I opted 
last year for a contact lense (i.e. one  Mono Vision).  It has been trying 
as you have to get used to focusing with one eye for reading and the other 
for distance.  

I had a conversation with my eye doctor yesterday, wanting a miracle cure, 
you know, 20/20 vision in the form of, I don't know!!, a simple pair of 
contacts?  Or, Was I a candidate for surgery?  He said that we (former 
20/20's) were the worst when it came to contacts as we had the most difficult 
time accepting our perfect vision loss.  

Immediately, I was humbled....  ""Okay, okay, I hear you, I understand.""  
At least I CAN see with corrective lenses, so what if it is not perfect.  

As you read below, I really am much more blessed than the many, many, many 
people of the world...

I will never complain again (well... not for a few days anyway).  

Bless and be Blessed!!!

My diary indicates that I am free after 1700, London time.  I have already

head here in London.  I unfortunately cannot remember the name of the 
student, but also an Indian national, I believe.  That student was referred 
to me by one of our employees in India (again, name escapes me).  I am happy 
to speak with you, but as with the other MBA candidate, I think it is for HR 
in London to sort out with our commercial team if this is something they are 
willing to do, as it obviously results in some disclosure of info.  Also, is 
it seen by traders/HR as a possible recruiting tool (I also assume that is 
why youwant to get involved), either for Houston, London, or Mumbai offices?  
Again, though, that is something I am not in a position to decide/resolve.  
Feel free to call at 1700 if it is still useful for you.   thanks  mcs

Speaking from experience, I think that it's critical for Tanya and Anjam to 
visit MG in New York
and establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk 
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions 
between IT and quants
 will be very helpful.

Subject: Messages in wake of USA Today



Winner & Associates ( a public relations firm working for the Association of 
Oil Pipelines) wrote the following excellent advice about fielding press 
calls stimulated by this week's USA Today story.

* What happened in Bellingham was a tragic accident that all of us in the 
pipeline industry feel terrible about.

* It is critically important to us in the industry that we know precisely 
what happened so that we can learn from this tragic accident and improve all 
of our operations as much as possible.

* Because the accident investigation is still underway, no one can yet know 
what caused it, and it is not responsible or productive for anyone to 
speculate.

* The pipeline industry has an excellent safety record, one that is 
constantly improving.  We are proud of the job we do, and are always striving 
to do it better and safer.

* It is important always to understand what pipelines are and the essential 
part they play in our daily lives.

* Pipelines in this country deliver safely and efficiently much of the raw 
product America needs for a growing economy and its high quality of life.  
Pipelines deliver 2/3 of the petroleum products we use to fill our cars with 
gasoline, fill our planes with jet fuels, heat our homes with heating oil, 
and produce plastics, agricultural products, and pharmaceuticals.  Pipelines 
also are vital to the national defense of this country.

* The pipelines that we operate supply people and industries in this area and 
are essential to the quality of life we all enjoy.

* The public should know that the first line of defense against underground 
damage is preventing third-party damage, for the public can play an important 
role in accident prevention.

* Excavation damage is the largest single cause, by far, of pipeline 
accidents.

* The pipeline industry is leading an intense effort nationwide, and in this 
area as well, to institute programs that will help prevent this kind of 
damage.  Our company is an active participant in this effort.



Should reporters wish to discuss the reauthorization process, company 
spokespersons can deliver the following messages in a general way, or can 
refer reporters to AOPL for a more detailed discussion.

* The reauthorization process in the Congress occurs every four years and is 
taking place this year.  The process is a good way to review performance and 
to consider new ideas.  We believe in strong federal regulation of the 
industry and its safety standards. We are always open to discussing new ideas 
to improve safety.

* It is important that pipeline operations be regulated as total systems.  
Our companies operate across state lines and, therefore, it is imperative 
that the federal government establish a set of rules that apply uniformly in 
each of the fifty states.

* States do have an important role to play.  We need states to be involved in 
pipeline safety.  Over 75% of pipelines are intra-state pipelines, and state 
regulatory activities and resources should be concentrated there.

* State law governs the one-call process, the process that lets an excavator 
make one call to have any underground facilities marked before beginning the 
job.  It is the first line of defense against underground damage.

* Maintaining pipeline integrity is our number one job.  We use a range of 
tools to test pipeline integrity: cathodic protection, smart pigs, 
hydrostatic testing, and visual inspection.  Each pipeline is unique, and 
different integrity measures apply to different pipelines.

* The Office of Pipeline Safety understands the industry and its safety 
efforts.  It is developing a rule that will require all companies to publicly 
explain the methods they are using to test their pipelines. This rule will 
encompass all of the testing tools and focus on how the information is 
brought together to make an informed judgment about a given pipeline's 
integrity.

Thanks for sending this message.  Checked with Baird and his initial view is 
that we should say something in the form of an additional release if Monday 
comes and we can't complete our Q.  He will discuss with Rex and give me 
final input as soon as possible.  I know this isn't a desirable result, but 
Bob thinks we'd be worse off if we said nothing-and then waited for people 
to call us.  We wouldn't need to say much, just something to the effect that 
we are continuing to work through the open integration issues, etc.  The 
specific wording would have to be worked out internally. I believe Susan and 
Dana also believe that we should say something if we can't complete the Q on 
Monday.  I'm in Ireland with my son, but I will follow up on this with IR and 
others and advise. Thanks.  SWD

The past several weeks have been especially difficult for everyone.  I do 
appreciate, however, the tremendous effort everyone has made to identify and 
fix the problems that keep surfacing.

At times like these, it is human nature to place the blame.  Such an exercise 
is pointless.  In my opinion, there were a lot of things that we would ALL do 
differently if we had the chance to do them over again.

The important issues now are:

Let's get it right;
let's learn from our mistakes;
let's recognize that we have to work as a team to accomplish 1. and 2. above; 
and,
let's appreciate how our job performance impacts the performance of the team.

Also, let's not forget that the commercial trends are favorable.  We appear 
poised to turn the corner.  Stabilizing our systems, getting good regional 
profit and loss data, which will improve our commercial decision-making, 
coupled with aggressive cost reductions, will get us to the promised-land.

Thanks again,
Stan

to disclose the deal.  I would rather not disclose a ""tentative deal"".

Subject: Phoenix/Equilon Deal; CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION AND 
ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT


	

Joe R. will be sending out something in greater detail shortly, but it 
appears that Equilon's management would like to pursue a deal with us on an 
exclusive basis and that this decision is being forwarded to the Equilon 
Board for approval.  If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get 
organized-in the near term-on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, 
but one thing we should start thinking about now is the ""disclosure"" issue.

If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this 
transaction , Equilon will probably want  to sign a memorandum of 
understanding with us, and this may put us in a ""disclosure"" posture because 
at that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a 
closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past 
dealings with these people).  Even without a signed document, the 
""size/probability"" test would still be an issue for us to deal with.  
Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's 
Board. Thanks.   SWD

		 Subject: EOTT: Call to McAndrews



I spoke with Jim McAndrews late this afternoon.  I told him EOTT was 
interested in following up on the possibility of settling the case, which he 
left open after the trial.

He said that, after trial, London concluded they wanted to, in essence, buy 
out all of Enron Corp's coverage and were not interested in settling the case 
on its own.  They corresponded with Jim Studdert a few times during the 
winter, but Jim responded in a way that John said was rude.

If we are interested in talking about a buy-out, London would be interested.  
I told him that would be very difficult for EOTT to arrange, as it is not the 
sole insured.  I asked if buying out just EOTT's coverage was a possibility.  
He pointed out that there is a strong connection between the two (Enron's 
listing in Martindell lists EOTT's attorneys, he claims) and thinks it could 
be done as one package.  In any event, London really wants to deal with all 
the coverage under the Internorth policies.

I told him I had heard about the buy-out campaign elsewhere and had forwarded 
material to Studdert on that issue.  I need to follow-up with Studdert and 
Duffy to figure out where Enron/EOTT is on this issue now.

I asked what number his people would be willing to pay just to settle the 
Ashland claim, in the likely event that there could be no buy-out.  He said 
he would need to talk with London about that.  I suspect it will be quite 
small.

We agreed that we would each speak with our people and get back in touch 
early next week.

I left a voice mail with Steve to this regard, but I'm copying him as well 
for his information.

Subject: The Koch S-1

Today I received a somewhat unpleasant letter from Mr. Mark Wilson at Koch.  
Koch is saying that it has been damaged by the delay in the registration of 
its EOTT common units and is making veiled threats of legal action against 
EOTT.  The tone of Mr. Wilson's letter is inappropriate in my view.  I will 
send each of you a copy of Mr. Wilson's letter and I will work with Bob Baird 
in framing an appropriate response from EOTT.  At this juncture, since it now 
appears that it will be at least several more weeks before we know whether 
the Phoenix deal will become ""disclosable,""  it might make sense to advise 
Koch about Phoenix on the condition of strict confidentiality (Dana's 
suggestion).  Bob, could we do this?  If we could do this, Koch would be able 
to appreciate the dilemma posed by the Phoenix deal and how this impacts the 
S-1 filing.  SWD

Bob Baird and I are already working with Tye Darland at Koch on this general 
issue.  Tye is Koch's in-house securities lawyer.  Shelly should not call 
Koch.  Instead, Bob and I should arrange any larger EOTT/Koch meeting through 
Tye or we could wind up with confusion and possible legal difficulties.  At 
this juncture, Bob and I think it best to let the lawyers for the two sides 
handle the initial discussions on these matters (because there are potential 
inside information issues involved, etc.).  If you agree, Bob and I will 
contact Tye Darland to see how Koch wishes to proceed.

Also, everyone needs to be aware that we still have a contractual duty to 
Koch to facilitate the sale of their EOTT units through a registration 
process.  Due to our late 10-Q filing, we will now have to do an S-1 
registration for Koch instead of an S-3, and this will be considerably more 
expensive and involved.

Mike/Steve-

I think that we need to set up a meeting with Koch to discuss their request 
to sell shares and our current issue re the first quarter.  I suggest that 
Shelly call Koch -and set up the meeting.  If you agree please respond so 
Shelly can set up.  If you have any questions please give me a call.

- An introduction to iBuyit for first-time users and to present the purpose and valuable time/cost saving benefits of the system.
Increased contract compliance and leverage purchasing power.
Reduce procurement time and effort with automated processes.
Control spend through electronic approval routing.
Increased order/coding accuracy.

- How to request new product additions to the catalog.
- Default data entry by HR org structure.
- Populating other required fields.

From a timing perspective, I told Christian that it would probably take at least 6-8 weeks to develop a curve, especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers/fundamentals.  As was suggested yesterday during our meeting, a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a NYMEX component (e.g., crude oil) would provide a great beginning pointwe could then potentially strengthen/augment  this relationship with other key factors (e.g., supply and demand terms) borne out of our market research.

Nelson"

I wanted to keep you up-to-date on the redevelopment of forward curves for the suite of 7 plastics (ethylene contract, ethylene spot, propylene contract, propylene spot, polypropylene, HDPE, LLDPE).  As you may recall, we talked about fitting all of the components into a VAR model and solving the system of simultaneous equations.  Unfortunately, with a limited dataset (say 5 years or so), our degrees of freedom in such a model are dramatically reduced.  Alternatively, Mauricio and I have decided to construct individual models for each of the plastics commodities while utilizing results from the initial VAR analysis as a guide.  

Based on the petrochemicals flowsheet, both propylene and ethylene are fashioned directly from raw materials such as crude oil, coal, and natural gas.  In turn, polypropylene may be made from propylene while HDPE and LLDPE use ethylene as a raw material.  Given this logical flow, we restricted our model specifications in the following manner (all price variables tested for stationarityfirst difference used in all cases):

1) Construct models for ethylene contract and ethylene spot based on AR terms, WTI, and natural gas.  Determine the ""best"" model between ethylene contract and ethylene spot as a function of these variables (based on R2).

2) Supplement the model above with the smaller R2 value with the contemporaneous and lagged values of the dependent variable from the other model (e.g., construct ethylene contract as a function and WTI and natural gasconstruct ethylene spot as a basis to ethylene contract).

3) Repeat the process for propylene refinery grade and propylene chemical grade.  

4) For polypropylene, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of propyleneRG, propyleneCG, WTI, and natural gas.

5) For HDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, WTI, and natural gas.

6) For LLDPE, construct a model based on AR terms, contemporaneous and lagged values of ethylene contract, ethylene spot, HDPE, WTI, and natural gas.

Note that we are aware of the ""cascading error"" problem as we move from model to model.  Alternatively, we can construct each model based only on WTI and natural gas (see first-cut of polypropylene model).  We do have monthly fundamental supply and demand information for 3 of the plastics (polypropylene, HDPE, and LLDPE) and will incorporate this data as well.  Alan Engberg has forwarded the latest 12 month forward curves from the current model that is being used.  He has also offered his own projections for these commodities over the next 12 months.  We'll compare the revised model projections with both the old model projections and Alan's numbers and then make a decision on next steps.

Jo's number in Omaha is 402-398-7707.  Per our discussions, I did meet with Vernon Mercaldo and Sean Bolks yesterday to discuss the options needs of Northern Natural Gas (at the request of Jo).  They are interested in developing about 6 different models w/ varying degrees of complexity.  I am currently in the process of expeditiously figuring out C++ and the associated linkage to Excel for final model development.  I did speak with Krishna this morning w/regard to their needs and he seems more than willing to help in this area.

nelson.neale@enron.com,"

The proposal does emphasize the importance of stationary time series and the cointegration approach using an error correction model (ECM) or vector error correction model (see Bessler's CV publications).  These remarks offer reassurance that we have probably been taking the right approach in our other modeling work (e.g., diesel fuel-heating oil cointegration, JCC-Brent crude cointegration, etc.).  We haven't yet implemented VAR in our price modeling work, but will likely use this approach for the suite of plastics (e.g., polypropylene, propylene, ethylene, HDPE, etc.) as well as for price indexes within the tech sector (e.g., semiconductor equity index, pc equity index, etc.)

For the record, we have been working with EIM fundamentals on the development of a newsprint price curve.  Cointegration was considered for newsprint price, lumber prompt month futures, and pulp prompt month futures; however, the correlation analyses suggested that the difference relationships were very weak.  We instead focused on developing price as a function of newsprint supply and demand terms (e.g., North American and Canadian production, producer inventory, US newsprint demand, total newspaper dailies inventory, consumer days of supply, etc.).

In short, I don't have a problem with the TAMU approach or the scope of work.  If EIM fundamentals does carry through with this relationship, it might be beneficial to offer some research input along the way, especially since we are somewhat familiar with the technical approach and the needs of the Enron business units.

I had a chance to speak today with a representative from Estima, the maker of RATS.  Evidently, our current license is as follows:

		Version:  RATS 4.0 (original license cost of $ 1,200.00)
		Max. No. of Users: 4

The following options outline the costs of upgrading the software:

Option 1

Version:  RATS 5.0
Users: Site license for Houston/unlimited

	RATS 5.0	$ 5,100.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00    	(cointegration module)
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00    	(RATS implementation of Census Bureau's seasonal adjustmentaids in 			$ 7,500.00       	adjusting quarterly and monthly data as well as options for identifying 					trading days and holidays in time series) 

Option 2

Version:  RATS 5.0
Users: 100

	RATS 5.0	$ 4,500.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00
			$ 6,900.00

Option 3

Version: RATS 5.0
Users: 50

	RATS 5.0	$ 3,600.00
	CATS module	$ 1,200.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,200.00
			$ 6,000.00

Option 4

Version RATS 5.0
Users: 25

	RATS 5.0	$ 2,500.00
	CATS module	$ 1,100.00
	X-11 module	$ 1,100.00
			$ 4,700.00

Note that we currently have a number of users of RATS both within Research and throughout EGM (Equities, Freight, Fundamentals, Crude Products).  I would recommend, at a minimum, that we upgrade our license to 50 users with base RATS 5.0.  Cointegration can obviously be performed without the automated CATS moduleI am not too certain of the utility of the X-11 module.

Resolved:

	Confirmations will be done out of AEP's systems for long term deals, intramonth transactions
	will be confirmed using DECAF 2.  DECAF 1 will not be used.

	Global Facilities will not need to copied to a new pipeline code.

	The HPL DUN's number will remain the same.

	Deal entry will be manual for AEP risk system and getting old deals back into Sitara.
	The need to build a cross-reference table is the main driver.

New items

	A hands-on  training program is unlikely due to time  and space constrains.
	AEP/Enron evaluating options.

	New Risk Portfolios need to created in Sitara.  List provided to AEP.
	Enron giving explanations of portfolios for usefulness to AEP.

	Manual entries to G/L and reports needed to book all items.


All items on the Energy ops issues list were discussed.  AEP to fill in point person
for there side. 

Agreement reached to use this format and add items as needed.

I will issue a revised transitions issues list tomorrow afternoon, after my energy ops
meeting.




 "
bob.hall@enron.com,"

Please review and send any changes so I can update.

I will update again Thursday and will include a column for status.

We are in the process of drafting procedures which will have to become a formal protocol for AEP.

These are:

Request for New/maintenance of counterparties.  Once Web page is developed, procedures will
be completed.

Request for new portfolios (books) after close.  Drafting procedures.

Request for new employee security.

Request to change curve mapping in ERMS/CPS.  Drafting procedures.

Also, it appears the IT service agreement may have to be amended to cover the 
Web pages used to push operational data to customers (If AEP wants to continue
the service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.

Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit has request we suspend trading when
AEP wants to continue trading.

We have had discussions with AEP about all of these issues and procedures.





 
"
bob.hall@enron.com,"

We will have to come up with a way to confirm just certain deals and not all deals.

I will add to the meeting for next week.

Attached below is the list and where we stand on reconcilations.  About 50% are reconciled, meaning that
the counterparty agrees with our number.

Most we are waiting on information from the counterparty.

The big items are the imbalances with Duke Energy, Gulf Energy, and Tejas.

Rita and I have people working with these counterparties to get good information.

Notes: 1) Nicor does not currently have an ILL Power service drop.(They are totally self gen.) 
           2) We would build line up to Com Ed and buy at the substation."
ned.higgins@enron.com,"

Deal info: IP is the Utility relative to our proposed NICOR transaction
Facility: Nicor Storage Facility at Troy Grove, Ill

Note: IP is owned by Dynegy, however, I understand that IP is bound by ""affiliate rules"" with regards to Dynegy. How comfortable are you with this? Do you think we need additional language in the CA to protect us?


With regards to the Devon CA the following are the Devon comments;
 

You should add at the beginning of paragraph 3, the following:  ""Each party represents that in providing Confidential Information to the other, it has the right and authority to do so.""
Whenever we look at a CA, we should endeavor to limit it in time and coverage.  You say that the agreement concerns purchase of electricity in the Carthage area, but in the opening paragraph, the CA states that it is related to ""a proposed sale and/or purchase of natural gas or fuel.""
You should get this clarified to say something more definitive.  For example, more definitive language would be something like ""...in connection with a proposed sale and/or purchase of electricity in the Carthage Field area for purpose of providing power to compression facilities.""
Other than that, the CA looks good.  Thanks.

Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and comply with our data retention policies.  These policies are not new.  I have previously sent out e-mails delineating our policy.  This e-mail simply serves as a reminder.  

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Palo Verde 3 began their refueling outage this past weekend.  During
inspections at Mode 5 (cold shutdown) they discovered a couple cracks
(leaks) in their reactor coolant system.  One was at a temperature detector,
the other was at the pressurizer.  The refueling outage had been expected to
last about a month (restart 10/30/01).  These cracks may delay restart due
to very heightened NRC concern about this kind of cracking.  We will keep
you posted on plans and schedule changes for this outage.

During the first two weeks of January we would like to hold training sessions for people in our office.  The goal is to provide an overview of each major function in our office to anyone who is interested in learning about what goes on here.  My current thinking is to spend an hour each day, say from 11 AM until noon, in training.  One or more people from each group will be responsible for coming up with an outline/agenda and leading an hour long session on what you do.  If you have received this e-mail, you have been tentatively nominated by me to lead or co-lead one of the training sessions.

Here are the sessions that I propose:

Overview		Tim Belden and/or Chris Calger
Risk			John Postlethwaite
Scheduling		Stacey Runswick, Donald Robinson, Diane Cutsforth
Fundamentals		Tim Heizenrader
Real Time		Bill Williams
Term Trading		Matt Motley
Cash Trading		Sean Crandall
California Market	Jeff Richter
Middle Market		Stewart Rosman and Paul Choi
Services		Chris Foster
Credit			Susan Rance
RTO Development	Alan Comnes
Legal			Christian Yoder
BPA			Steve Hall

Here are some ideas to consider for presentations:
What does your job entail  important timelines and workflow during the day.
Inputs and Outputs to your job  information and people
Who are your internal/external customers?
What is the purpose of your job?
Lingo - what is the vocabulary of your job?

At our meeting I would like to brainstorm potential ideas for the presenations and get some group input on what should be covered and how it should be covered.  Thanks for your help with this."

Subject:	WSCC Reserve Standard

Tim,

After receiving Dick's message regarding the changes in the WSCC Reserve Standard, I went through the documents to try to understand the change being proposed.  I also made talked with some of the people who have been participants in the development of the new standard, to check on my understanding and ask a few follow-up questions.

While on its face, the reserve requirements are being lowered the standard is actually being tightened, because the new standard deals with the locations at which reserves are covered.  In the past, a party could carry all of its spin on a single unit.  The new standard is based on governor responses to frequency excursion.  It requires that the reserve be spread across more units or that special control features be added to AGC to allow carrying more reserves on some machines.  

As Dick indicated in his note, there is some potential for a reduction in system transfer capability.  For instance, carrying more reserves on NW hydro units in some hydrological conditions has the potential to reduce the Pacific Intertie rating by up to 20%.  However, given the limited reserves available in California, we are probably already in this condition.  With California at 1.5% reserve, there is a concern that the rating is already impacted.  On the other hand, when more generation comes on-line in California with new construction, then the reserve levels rise and the impact on transfer capability is mitigated.  

The other effect of this change is that it reduces the amount of Frequency Response Reserve (FRR) that California has to buy.  Whether the change in the responsibility to buy actually changes to pattern of reserves on machines cannot be determined at present.  However the change does have financial benefits to those who are chronically short of FRR.

Finally, I wondered how the shift to from individual control areas to a single control area with the formation of RTO West would affect the reserve requirements, since the new standard talks about carrying reserves by control area or reserve sharing pool.  I was reminded that the Northwest is a reserve sharing pool.  Since , the Northwest Power Pool and RTO West represent essentially the same portion of the system.  the RTO formation will not result in a major change in requirements.  

If you have additional questions, I will dig deeper.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it ""right"" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

The purpose of this e-mail is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible.  I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing.  My apologies for this.  Hopefully this e-mail will accomplish that goal.

A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals.  As a result, we haven't been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money.  Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.  Instead, these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices.

We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have.  We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional pre-petition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money.  We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December 27th (I think) and we will secure additional cash to continue on.

Here are the procedures as I understand them.  If you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.

Cash Desk
Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.
On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.
If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.  We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location.
The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate (based on spot market prices) of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome.
The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via e-mail.
The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current.

Marketing Desk
Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk.
The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis.
The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder.
Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve Hall/Christian Yoder at (503) 464-8058.
The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis.  We don't necessarily care who buys it, but rather, we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated.
Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome.

Deal Entry
The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle.  After discussing the matter with Stacey White, she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price, non MTM, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.
We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.
This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door.  It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice.

I'm sure that I've missed something.  Let me know.

Regards,
Tim"

It appears that in our efforts to collect information from the pipelines we are duplicating some efforts. 

Rita Wynne's team is also actively collecting and reviewing pipeline invoice information. She has suggested that we coordinate with her team to more efficiently gather the information and keep the pipelines from getting bombarded with requests. The pipelines have been assigned to specific people in her group.

We should continue to contact the pipelines and request a list of their active agreements, inform them of our intentions to work with them and let them know that someone in our group is in the process of confirming outstanding invoice information with them as well  and would appreciate their cooperation. We should then work directly with our internal contact to determine the status of the invoice claims.

Rita will need a prioritized list of the pipelines. We can get together as a group and decide on the best way to prioritize the list.  I will provide her with the same list that PW will get - ""Pipeline Status Summary"" so that she can get a feel on were we stand with each pipeline. She will also have access to the detailed contract list were we are tracking the dollar amounts for each agreement.

Invoice indicates that the PAL Contract number is PAL1001 for both.
Deal 1424 is the one that shows a negative (96,000) balance and Deal 1222 indicates a 266,241 balance.

Kelli's spreadsheet indicates that 8588 was sold a day Jan 1-Jan 8, 2002. This sell needs to be verified as well as the price it was sold for. If this sell is correct, the new balance would be 197,537?

Like I mentioned before, Kelli indicates that a letter was received that indicates that the 96,000 was withheld for PAL and 101,437 was withheld until payment received. I do not have a copy of the letter, but it would be helpful to know who in legal is working on this.

Since the volume is so small and does match the amount listed in TXOK it is highly possible that this an error.

First, I think it's dangerous for me to walk into any of the PNW Senator or 
Congressman's offices and talk about our interests in legislation on the 
retail side.  Their key focus will be BPA and you (not me) are clearly the 
expert on those issues.  I am planning on handling (or others in the Western 
States Group will handle) non-PNW states, but I think it makes more sense 
for  you to meet with the PNW folks (either with me or without me) because of 
their focus on BPA issues. 

Second, since you are already working so closely with Congressional staffers, 
it may not be necessary to visit with the Senators and Congressmen when 
they're home.  

The only reason to do so, is that you do get better access to the members 
themselves when they're home.   In this regard, you may want to talk with 
Cynthia and Craig Gannett about a visit with Slade Gorton, Gordon Smith, and 
Ron Wyden.  

I've met Smith (who probably won't remember me) and had dinner with Wyden at 
former law partner's house (so he may remember me)let me know what you 
think.   I'd be happy to join you and talk about state issues, but it only 
makes sense in my mind if you are their to talk about BPA stuff."

Subject: Brifing for German parliament members

Through my environmental work, I was contacted by a German foundation that is 
hosting several members of the German parliament on a U.S. visit.  They will 
be visiting San Francisco on April 26 and 27, and are interested in learming 
more about the California energy situation.  

Would it be possible to conduct a meeting/briefing for this delegation at our 
San Francisco office?   These are not energy experts, but legislators who are 
interested in the U.S. policy process, so the briefing would not need to be 
anything complex, and probably no more than 1 hour long.  Please let me know 
if you would be available and willing to host this group.

They are sending brief biographies of the German delegation, and more 
specific time availability on the 26th/27th, and will pass it on to you when 
I get it.

Thanks,

Jeff

It appears from talking with both of you that we have some confusion on how 
we will contract for legal services to support or legislative efforts.  
Hopefully this e-mail will clarify the process so there is no confusion in 
the future and so that Mike can feel comfortable he is completing work that 
is authorized and for which we have a budget.

1.  To begin, it appears that Goodin, MacBride has billings as of May 11 for 
approximately $10,000 on direct access, windfall profits, the ""Global 
Settlement,"" Power Plant Siting.  We will cover these amounts because of the 
apparent confusion with our budgeting and approval process.  The amounts 
already incurred should be included in the RCRs discussed below.  

2.  As we discussed yesterday, the work associated with the billings in May 
was conducted without any RCR approval or any budget in place.  As you know 
we terminated the two legislative retainers at the end of April.  No RCRs 
were filed to cover the matters on which work was completed in May.    

I did receive a budget on legislative matters on May 8.  However, a decision 
was made only yesterday to proceed on a specific matter-by-matter basis; the 
work in May should not have been undertaken while we considered whether to 
proceed with an overall legislative budget or proceed with specific RCRs.  In 
short, a proposed budget is not RCR approval.  

3.  In the future, any work undertaken by Goodin MacBride should only be 
conducted pursuant to an approved RCR.  If an emergency arisesi.e., an 
issue arises that could not have been contemplated, then I should be 
contacted before completing any work.  If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes 
should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, then Rick Shapiro should be 
contacted.   In this regard, I authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in 
the Direct Access coalition meetings taking place today and tomorrow.  I also 
authorized Goodin MacBride to participate in a telephonic conference on the 
Calderon bill.  To the maximum extent possible, I expect that Mike will 
include Leslie Lawner in future Direct Access meetings, legislative drafting 
efforts, etc.  

4.  If there is any confusion on whether there is RCR approval for a 
particular matter, I should be contacted before undertaking an assignment.  
If I am unavailable, Jim Steffes should be contacted.  If Jim is unavailable, 
then Rick Shapiro should be contacted.  I can be reached through my office 
line503.464.7945, pager888.916.2262, or cell phone 503.539.4733.  I wear 
the pager at all times and respond immediately to messages left on the 
pager.  

5.  Today, Sandy is filing several RCRs for legislative support on Direct 
Access, Siting, Windfalls Profits, and the Global Settlement.  They will be 
considered at next Monday's RCR conference call.  If they are approved, Sandy 
will manage the Goodin MacBride assignments associated with Direct Access, 
Siting, and Windfalls Profits.  

Jeff Dasovich will manage all work associated with the Global Settlement, 
whether it is legislative or not.  This does not mean that Sandy cannot give 
assignments to Goodin MacBride; it simply means that before that work begins 
Jeff must approve the work.  

This particular issue is a critical matter for our company.  Jeff is involved 
in the strategy and business calls concerning this matter and is working on a 
daily basis with Jim Steffes, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean to develop our 
position and advocate that position in the settlement discussions.  We must 
ensure that our Sacramento efforts are fully coordinated with our strategy 
and business interests (as they develop through the settlement 
discussions).   To avoid any confusion on the scope of Jeff's responsibility, 
I consider all legislation addressing the Edison MOU, any future MOUs with 
Sempra, and ""Plan B,"" to be part of the Global Settlement.  

Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.  I 
recognize that Sacramento is a difficult environment and that there is 
substantial pressure on both of you.  However, we are under an obligation to 
use our internal and external resources in the best and most cost-effective 
manner.  The RCR process is designed to meet that responsiblity.  "

Enron has decided to outsource our accounts payable department and also 
implement a whole new system for paying invoices.
What this means to all of us is you may receive email(s) from iBuyit 
Payables.  These are very important emails!  These are invoices
that need to be paid.  Any ENA people receiving invoices should automatically 
assume they go to me.  As for Sue's group I think
any invoices you receive will need to go to Joseph.  If you are unsure please 
let he or I know and we can figure out which one of us should
get the invoice.

Here is the irritating part: You can not just forward the iBuyit Payables 
email to me/him.  You must click onto the first link in the email (see 
example below).
Then log on to the iBuyit Payables system using your P00# and log-on password 
(these are the same P00# and password you use to access
eHRonline).  At this point you will be at your iBuyit Payables in-box.  I 
pasted a copy of my in-box below as an example.  There are boxes to check
if you want to forward the invoice.  If you check them all then click on 
'Quick Forward' a forward box will appear.  Type in mine, or Joseph's (if 
it's his
invoice) last name in the 'last name' box, then click search.  From there you 
can click 'Forward'.  I will not only ensure the invoice is paid, but also 
give the vendor the correct information for future invoices.

Please bare with me during this time.  This whole process isn't going to be 
very much fun for any of us.  However, I have made it my priority to have 
this new invoice situation organized as quickly as possible.  If anyone has 
any questions please let me know.  On one last note:  All paper invoices 
should still be given directly to me then I can send them to A/P for scanning.

This is in response to our meeting of April-10-2001 in Midland with Agave.

Assuming units #761 and #762 are now assigned to LEC-10"" service, the below schematic is showing the capacity of the three remaining units #822, #842 and #845 at Atoka-3.

At suction pressure of 225 psig and discharge pressure of 560 psig the capacity is 36 mmcf/d.  






The 36 mmcf/d is not a fixed capacity, if discharge pressure increases the capacity decreases. Basically it depends on the volume activities between Atoka-3 and Atoka-1 such as BP, Rio Pecos and GPM.
Please pass this on to Agave.

If you have any questions please call.

mansoor.abdmoulaie@enron.com,"



Michelle

In order to make this interconnect bi-directional the following work need to be performed: 
( capacity 35- 60 mmcf/d at 800-850 # pressure)

1):  Blowdown gas in 5.335 miles of 12"" ( gas-loss) at 1000# pressure

2):	Remove a flapper in the check-valve or turn around the existing check-valve


The  cost for this is approximately $8,000 to $10,000.

Still waiting for Earl Chanley from Roswell to send me some facility information regarding the Pecos interconnect.

Mansoor
					"
mansoor.abdmoulaie@enron.com,"

The existing capacity of this system is 38 mmcf/d.
Now that we know where the exactl location of the tie-in is and based on  your input I have created two flow modeling options for this project::
 
Option-1:
Assuming 30 mmcf/d from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can do another 12 mmcf/d from Conoco at 576 psig pressure for a total of     42 mmcf/d. If the pressure at Lanam Ranch reduces, it will change the capacity to a lower figure. 
  			

  Option-2:
  Assuming 0 (zero) from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can handle 62 mmcf/d from Conoco at 696 psig pressure.

						


If the pressure at Conoco reduces, it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity.
If you have any comments please e-mail me as soon as you can so we can finalize the capacity of this system.

Subject:	RE: ConocoProjReqForm.xls

 1 What is the legal description of this tie- in? Northeast corner of R35E, T20S, Section 24

  2) What is the maximum pressure that Conoco can provide at this point?  Per Conoco, max sustainable pressure would be 700#

  3) If the volume from Conoco is going to be 60 mmcf/d, how much gas are you planning to flow from the existing Lanam Ranch interconnect ( 0 to 30 mmcfd range)
	We would only flow 60mm from Conoco if Linam was delivering 0.   Conoco would be the ""swing"" supplier"" based on what Linam was giving to TW.  If you determine that with Conoco's interconnect location and operating pressure that the Monument line and compressors would do 75mm (for example), and Linam gives us 20mm, then we theoretically could take 55mm from Conoco.

  4) What is the pressure commitment at Lanam Ranch  - Per Darrel, at over 620#, we start to hit the pressure regulator for the Class III shut in valve, so plan on no more than 620.


 "
mansoor.abdmoulaie@enron.com,"

Based on our meetings, I thought if TW pursues this we might get some of this gas supply to our system and I have made the following assumptions :

n	BP has 50 mmcf/d at 750 psig
n	Agave   75 mmcf/d at 750 psig     
n	NGPL   42 mmcf/d at 750 psig

   Total             167 mmcf/d.



To tie 167 mmcf/d to TW-36"" at 950 psig pressure would require 4,000 hp recip units.
The estimated ""A"" release cost (+-30%) is approximately $6,000,000.

The following is a level ""A"" cost estimate to make TW/ Lonestar existing interconnects bi-directional.


TW/ Lonestar at Ward County ( 50 to 60 mmcf/d)


According to Operations this is already bi-directional . The only things are required on this one is to take the flapper out of the check-valve 
and blow down the gas in 5.33 miles of 12"".

Cost of gas loss& labor = $8,000




TW/ Lonestar at Pecos County ( 100 mmcf/d)

A): TW/ Lonestar interconnect


	Scope: On this one we need a bi-directional valve skid using the existing meter run.
	Cost of material& labor= $ 195,000


B): Pecos Compressor Station

    	 In order to make this interconnect bi-directional we also need to make the station ( two-compressor units) bi-directional.
	
Scope: Install outlet from Lonestar I/C to inlet filter with 12"" piping& valves. Unit discharge would be modified to
tie in to West Texas-20""
	
Cost for material& labor= $ 330,000.
	
If you need more accurate costs ( B -release) please let me know .

	Total cost estimate for this project = $ 533,000.

Endorse the recent CAL ISO report on causes of the problem (no utility 
forward buying, no demand responsiveness, etc) and say, with a few tweaks, 
their proposals were on target.

Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01.  Retroactive roll-off would be 
devastating.

Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier 
in place (get them out of merchant supply).

Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration.

Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of 
under-recoveries until out years. 

Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as 
possible, post '01.

Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts:
  Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be 
definitive.  Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the 
right numbers.

From a retail perspective, this blends protection of the book with 
advancement of new market opportunity.  I may still get more feedback from 
the EES guys, but wanted to give you what I got so far.

Harry.  We want later surcharge, lower surcharge, less recovery of utility 
shortfall.

I hope this helps in defining our strategy for evidence.
-"
harry.kingerski@enron.com,"

There is a 75% probability that customers who go to direct access and who 
used utility service between January and June 2001 will pay an exit fee 
calculated as the difference between market price and utility rates during 
that period.  The exit fee could also include the going forward costs or 
alternatively, those costs could be passed along in the form of a uniform 
surcharge.  In other words, with regard to past costs, regulators or 
legislators would require DA customers to pay the amount they belive had been 
sucked from the state during the January-June crisis period.  I said the 
""retroactive ratemaking"" argument is a nicety that California could easily 
dispense with.

Now that we know the CPUC decision will be delayed, I think the probability 
of exit fees for retroactive costs is even higher - either the DA legislation 
will pass between now and July 3, or Carl Wood will change the PUC order to 
get the ""jailbreaking"" customers to pay up. 
"
harry.kingerski@enron.com,"

CDWR has until 1/1/03 to fill the utility short position.  They will be doing 
the fill over that time, maybe up-front, maybe not.  DA should be allowed to 
proceed without inconvenience to CDWR so long as :

the net short to be filled minus the portion of the short already filled is 
greater than the direct access load.

In other words, say net short to be filled is 40% on a utility, at a given 
point in time the portion already filled is 30%, DA should proceed as long as 
it doesn't exceed 10% at that time.   The balance could be calculated weekly, 
if necessary, up to say September 1, 2002, at which time DA would definitely 
be closed.  If the amount available for DA is close to CDWR's remaining short 
to be filled, CDWR gives two weeks notice and DA is then suspended per 
Commission order before September 1, 2002.  

This approach makes the calculation utility specific, does not impede CDWR's 
efforts, gives the legislature maximum time to give a different DA fix, and 
gives the CPUC a graceful way out.  If the CPUC wanted to slam the door 
immediately, seems to me they would have done that in the draft order.

Let's collect comments on this and then see what AReM and others are up to."
harry.kingerski@enron.com,"

Transmission net plant (as of 1999):
PG&E,  $1.43 B
SCE,     $1.90 B

Distribution net plant (as of 1999):
PG&E,  $6.58 B
SCE,     $4.88 B

Total costs (revenue requirement) for Transmission (1999):
PG&E, $0.40 B    includes return on capital (0.12B), taxes, depreciation, o&m 
(0.10B)
SCE,     $0.57 B   includes return on capital (0.15B), taxes, depreciation, 
o&m (0.21B)

Transmission costs as % of total utility costs (1999):
PG&E,  5% 
SCE,     7%

Securitization of entire transmission revenue stream creates maybe $20 
million annually of additional head room for the 2 utilities (2% of $1B), 
plus whatever tax effects may accrue from state vs. private ownership.

A 50% premium to book value purchase generates a $1.7 B combined windfall to 
utilities, before tax effects, or about 15% of the under-recovered amounts of 
$13 B. 

Alan and I will work on refining these messages."

		 Subject: Draft Testimony re PGE/SCE for Discussion

Harry and I are meeting tomorrow.  I would like any feedback you have related 
to the following:

Based on our position we would prefer:
Later surcharges
Lower surcharges
Surcharges that are lower in the summer (flatter is better because it is 
closer, the NPV effects and our rapidly diminishing position)

The proposal below could either result in:
Delay of a month while they consider this complicated affair (low likelihood)
Lower surcharge if we can convince people that market rates are $300/MWh for 
a year when they are actually $200.  We would only get a $20/MWh increase, as 
compared to a $30/MWh increase.  ie (1-90%) times $300/MWh yields $30/MWh is 
our story when the actural is (1-90%)times $200/MWh yields $20/MWh.
The Enron rates below are effectively much flatter than the CPUC proposal.  
Thus we would be better off if accepted.
Additionally if our noise causes a flat $30/MWh increase to replace the CPUC 
proposal, we are better off.

Additionally, 
we could sell hedging on the 10% exposed to markets.
DSM related to capital investments should be less risky.

The risks to Enron are:
Proposal makes it easy to hit the large customers with a lower baseline (ie 
75% instead of 90%)
Would make DSM more risky.  DSM providers would have to buy hedges to proceed.

The questions to answer are:
Could Enron provide witnesses without drawing more negatives
Would a partner tow the Enron line

Just wanna give you a heads up.  From Settlements we learned that there will be -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments in your book due to BPA and Modesto related deals .  I have researched on all the items and believe they are valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  If you don't disagree you shall expect to see this hit in your P&L for 8/31/01.

 

Please also note that there might be other items to come between now and the end of this month.  I will let you know when that happens.

Thanks,

Attached please find the latest prior month adjuments to be entered in your P&L for 11/30/01.  The total amount will be 
-$1,616.76.  The biggest negative item (-$162,309.44) is explained by Settlements as due to ""multiple deals DJ index settling"" as you can see in the attached detail sheet.  I have asked Settlements to provide more details (deal numbers) so it might better help us understand where this negative adjustment is from.  I will send you the deal numbers as soon as I found out.

Please also note the attached file is preliminary.  There could be more to come from Settlements between now and month-end.  I'll update you if that happens.  Please take a look at the items listed now and let me know if you have any questions.

Attached please find all prior month adjustments we've taken from April up to the end of July.  Please note that normally Risk only makes prior month adjustments at the end of each month, and I have tracked your p&l at the end of April, May, June, and July and all the month-to-date adjustments match what's showing up in the attached speadsheet.

In the mean time I have saved all June's P&L statements in ""M:\common\Power\Riskmgmt\west temp"" folder.  Please note this folder will be deleted when you are done reviewing, as all the P&L statements are highly confidential.

 

Please also note that although the Modesto annuities were entered in June and July they wouldn't go into your P&L on the dates the annuities were entered because the flow date for those deals were all for prior months (April, May, and June).  In other words, for deals entered with a flow date that's already passed, they will not go into your P&L unless Risk makes manual adjustments.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

 "
fran.chang@enron.com,"

Please note that in addition to the -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments you've agreed in response to my prior email to you on 8/30, you will get +$6,594 for index price true up from deal #607801.  Therefore, the revised total adjustment you shall expect on 8/31/01's P&L is -$864,226.56.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Weather Graphics Proposal




Hi Dave!

Here's the proposal we discussed, which comes to $200/month. Normally we 
insist
on a minimum of $1,000/month, but I feel there are many bigger things we can
collaborate on down the road.

I haven't included pricing for the satellite and radar imagery because it's 
more
costly (I have fixed royalties that I have to pay on that) and because of the
complexity of having to track the number of users of Canadian radar.

On the North American satellite imagery, the cost would be $490/month on open
access and $380/month for restricted access, no limits on the number of users.

For Canadian radar, it's available as a restricted-access-only package of 
three
regional shots and a national image for $1,000/month minimum for the first 500
users, then $2/month/user for 501-1000 users, then $1.50 for users 1001-2500, 
$1
for users 2501-5000 and 75 cents/user thereafter. Simplicity is not a virtue 
on
this one, but these are restrictions imposed by Environment Canada, I'm 
afraid.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at (610) 407-2954 should you have any
questions or comments.

We look forward to serving your weather-information needs.

Best regards.

There would be a Euro 2000 icon on the EnronOnline quotes screen (the main 
page of our system).
The user would click on this icon, and a new browser window would open with 
the EnronOnline/Sports.com home page.  This will contain schedules, results, 
player profiles, etc.  It will also contain an icon for Minute Mania Contest.
When the user clicks on this icon, they would then go to a page that 
describes at a high level what the contest is.  Pick times for events (first 
goal, etc) and win prizes (digital video camera, etc).   We would also note 
here that the contest is only open to residents of UK, Germany, etc.  Click 
here to register.  
The user will then go to a screen that has several input boxes that include:  
Name, contact details (email, phone), user name for contest, and country of 
residence.  The country of residence box would either be a drop down that 
only includes choices for the countries that are eligible or would allow the 
user to type their country.  If the user has the ability to type their 
country then the system would then have a verification process that rejects 
those that are ineligible to participate.

The order of priority for the countries where we have users is:

UK
Germany
Belgium
Netherlands
Switzerland
Norway
Sweden
Finland
Denmark
Austria
Italy
Spain
France

Then there is also

US (largest customer base) -  state by state differences 
Canada (second largest group)
Australia
Japan

We also have users with guest ID's in Poland, Portugal, and Singapore. (we 
should confirm the laws here as well)

Please let me know if I can provide any further details.

Subject: comments on the agreement draft


David,
Thank you for sending the agreement draft on Friday. Here are my notes after
the first reading. If you wish to discuss those further, perhaps we can
schedule a time on the phone.
Preamble: We are a Delaware corporation.
Section 1: Definition: the attrition rate per your definition is diluted by
the addition of new clients. The attrition rate should calculated based on
the number of existing clients at the beginning of the agreement without
taking new clients into account.
Section 3: Termination of the Agreement should be mutual, and we cannot
agree to keeping the Exclusivity at the same level through any renewal
periods.
Section 5: the definition of competitors is too broad. We would like to see
something that more tightly defines electronic trading of wholesale
commodities. We would like to retain the ability to offer these services in
areas where Enron Online is not active, such as supply chain systems, and in
the retail markets for large commercial and industrial concerns. Also, I am
not sure  whether this is intended, but your reference to ""any Publication""
will give you exclusivity to ALL our publications for the fee set out in 4
a. That is not the intent.
Section 6 (b) should be removed (see comments on Section 1)
Section 10. we cannot agree to letting Enron disclose the existence of this
agreement without our consent. Any disclosure about this agreement,
including the fact of its existence, should be by mutual consent.
Section 12: we need a mirror section indemnifying us against all and any
claims against Enron Online. This would be a show-stopper for our lawyers.
Section 13: I am not sure we have such an insurance, but even if we did, I
am not sure why Enron is requiring this given that there is a clear
indemnification
Section 14 (a) three days seems unduly short. I would say 5 days is more
reasonable. There are no fee payments in advance, so I believe we can remove
mention of fees being paid back.
Section 17: we're really not looking for a monetary commitment from Enron on
helping us find illegal distribution. What is important to us is that Enron
has a contractual obligation to notify us immediately if it becomes aware of
any breach of copyright or illegal distribution. It would be good if that
were written into this section.
Section 29: typically, we do not agree to arbitration clauses for the simple
reason that these types disputes tend to end up in court anyway, and then
the two parties have spent money on arbitration and still have the legal
costs ahead of them. I believe we can live with this clause, but it would be
better if it were not there.
There might be a couple more points that come up from my colleagues or on a
second reading, but I believe these are the main sticking points at the
moment.

Abudi Zein

But there was a problem. 
Everything the princess touched would melt. 
No matter what; 
metal, 
wood, 
plastic 
anything she touched would melt. 

Because of this, men were afraid of her. 
Nobody would dare marry her. 

The king despaired. 
What could he do to help his daughter? 

He consulted his wizards and magicians. 
One wizard told the king, 

""If your daughter touches one thing 
that does not melt in her hands, 
she will be cured."" 

The king was overjoyed. 

The next day, 
he held a competition. 
Any man that could bring his daughter an 
object that would not melt would marry her 
and inherit the king's wealth. 

Three young princes took up the challenge. 

The first prince brought a very hard alloy of titanium. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
The prince went away sadly. 

The second prince brought a huge diamond, 
thinking that diamond is the hardest substance 
in the world and would not melt. 
But alas, 
once the princess touched it, 
it melted. 
He too was sent away disappointed. 

The third prince approached. 
He told the princess, 
""Put your hand in my pocket and feel what 
is in there."" 
The princess did as she was told, 
though she turned red. 
She felt something hard. 
She held it in her hand. 
And it did not melt!!! 

The king was overjoyed. 
Everybody in the kingdom was overjoyed. 
And the third prince married the princess 
and they both lived happily ever after. 


Question: 

What was the object in the prince's pants? 


(Scroll down for the answer) 

? 

? 

? 

? 

? 

They were M&M's of course. 
They melt in your mouth, not in your hand.

What were you thinking?

EES was not agreeing to what we (Enron Power) has in Enpower.  Per Phil 
Platter our numbers are correct and the worksheet needs to be updated to 
reflect Enpower.

EES stated they will adjust their numbers once they get an updated sheet. 
Thanks,

Mark "
mark.confer@enron.com,"

I spoke with Virginia and we agreed that variances which are listed as part 
of the schedule I will forward to you.  All others will go in to DMS.

Please let me know what you find out.

Thanks,

Kate you asked about deal #553219.1 EES shows this deal on the 16th at a 
price of $125.  They do not see this deal on their real time sheets for the 
19th. 

 

Thanks,

mark.confer@enron.com,"

Again, thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items.



Mark  "
mark.confer@enron.com,"

The only deal that I see that their may be an issue on is 535568.1 where the 
peak hours are still at 1070.75.  Any more information on this one?


Thanks

Subject: March EES-EPMI Revisions

I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet. It should reflect the latest 
volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing 
between EES and EPMI. Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an 
attempt to feed them through to the CARP report. Please let me know if you 
see the changes come through, Mark. 

The autoscheduled deals are:

533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
535419 - 3/2/01
535420 - 3/2/01
566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01
550208 - 3/15/01



The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES 
saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours 
should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the 
EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet. 


+____________
=         1016.75 

Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the 
CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up 
for March!

Thanks,
Kate

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

This is disturbing.  I can not understand how an HR employee for an Enron 
business unit can deny access to what appears to be an Enron auditor on the 
grounds that the records being sought are confidential.  As you know Sanjay 
reports to both Ken and myself in support of EBS Asia activities as well as I 
believe McDonald for Global Assets.  Given this split accountability, and the 
fact that I do not know which business unit these records apply to, you as a 
representative of Corp should probably require that Enron be given access to 
these records as part of your audit responsibilities.  If you think it 
appropriate for me to make the request I will be happy to do so.

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a ""Core School"" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.
